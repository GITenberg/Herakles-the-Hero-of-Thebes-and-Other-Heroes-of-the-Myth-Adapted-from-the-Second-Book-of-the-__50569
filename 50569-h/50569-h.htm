</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> child&rsquo;s heart goes out to the man of action,
the man who makes short work of things
and gets directly at a result. He responds to
life, to energy, quick wit, the blow that hits the
nail on the head at the first stroke.</p>

<p>The rapidity of action in the stories of Herakles,
Jason, and other Heroes of the Myth, the
prowess and courage and untiring endurance
of the men, render the characters worthy subjects
of thought to young minds, and have
secured the stories a permanent place in educational
literature. It is not elegant literature
alone that boys need, but inspiring ideals
which will impel them to stand fearlessly to
their guns, to do the hard thing with untiring
perseverance, to reach the result with unerring
insight.</p>

<p>It is exactly this unbending courage in Herakles
and his comrade heroes, that has made
them the backbone of literature for ages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vi]</a></span>
holding their own in spite of the sapless literary
fungus crowding our book-shelves.</p>

<p>While travelling in Greece I found the children
of the primary schools reading these
stories in the lower grades, the book being the
one used next above the primer. The interest
was enthusiastic, and I brought home a copy
of the book, which, with Madame Ragozin&rsquo;s
collaboration, I have arranged as a first or
second book of reading for our own schools.</p>

<span class="smlfont">THE LAND OF THE HEROES</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> look at the map of Greece will show us
that it is the smallest of European countries.
For many hundreds of years it was inhabited
by the handsomest, bravest, and most intelligent
people in the world. But these people,
the Greeks, or Hellenes, as they called themselves,
had not always lived in the country.</p>

<p>Thousands of years before the Hellenes came
to Greece it was a perfect wilderness of mountains,
narrow valleys, torrents, and tangled forests.
It was a land of wild beasts, and they
were so numerous and fierce that there was
almost no room for men.</p>

<p>Yet men did live there, but we know nothing
about them or what they were like, except that
they hid in caves and had hardly got beyond
the art of making fire, trapping and killing the
less dangerous animals with sticks or little arrows
pointed with stones, and using their meat
for food and hides for clothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xii]</a></span>
Then the new people, the Greeks, began to
come into the country. They came in boats
from across the sea and on foot from the north,
through numberless mountain-passes. They
did not come all at once, but in small detachments,
in single tribes, so that it took them
many years to spread over the country.</p>

<p>The new race was nobler than the old, more
advanced in knowledge and in the arts of civilized
life. It was not a race to be content with
caves and forest-dens, but each tribe, after it
had chosen a district and taken possession of
it, selected some high hill, built rude dwellings
upon it and temples to its patron gods, a public
treasure-house also, and enclosed the hill with
strong walls. It had become a fortress, and
was called Acropolis, in their language.</p>

<p>Each tribe, of course, had its leaders, usually
belonging to some family which had earned the
gratitude and loyalty of the people by brave
and affectionate service, and the leadership descended
from father to son. These were the
kings and they resided within the Acropolis.</p>

<p>Around it and under the protection of its
walls the people built their own huts and began
to clear the land. They sowed various crops,
planted the vine and the olive, and raised herds
of sheep and goats. There was room enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xiii]</a></span>
within the walls for all the families, with their
herds, to find shelter in the Acropolis in times
of danger, from the attacks of the wild natives
or of the still wilder beasts of the forests and
fields.</p>

<p>Now these latter were by far the most dangerous
enemies of the new settlers, who soon
found that they could venture but a few miles
from their small home-farms without encountering
huge and ferocious animals which the
increased herds attracted and which their miserable
weapons were utterly insufficient to slay
or even put to flight.</p>

<p>Each small district had its particular terror,
just as many districts of India now have a man-eating
tiger, which makes miles and miles of
country around unsafe for man or beast.</p>

<p>It became a question which of the two, the
men or the wild animals, would remain in possession.
Then young and courageous men,
sons of the ruling families, athletes in strength,
practised in the arts of war, commanding
through their greater wealth the use of better
weapons, felt it their duty to their people to do
for them what the poor herdsmen and laborers
had neither the strength nor the skill to do for
themselves.</p>

<p>From all the central royal cities they started
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xiv]</a></span>
singly or in small troops, a bevy of young
heroes, as eager for the delights of adventure
as for the public good. Year after year they
wandered across country seeking the most impassable
wildernesses, directed by the stories
they heard on their way to the dens of the
cruel monsters, which they usually overcame
by force or cunning.</p>

<p>Then they would return to their homes triumphant,
bearing the proof of their incredible
prowess, the hides, or horns, or heads of the
monsters they had slain. Thus they put new
heart into their people. Their trophies seemed
to say: &ldquo;You see these creatures were not so
terrible as they might have been; what we
have done others can do.&rdquo; So they did a
double good&mdash;one immediate by the destruction
of the dreaded foes and by the opening of the
land to the planters and the tillers; the other
even more far-reaching and more beneficent
in its results by raising men&rsquo;s spirits, inspiring
them with confidence and with the ambition to
show that they were not mere helpless boors,
cowed and dependent on their betters.</p>

<p>The Greek nation in years to come proved
itself a nation of heroes and was so called by
fame. But who can tell how much these heroes
were indebted for this honorable distinction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xv]</a></span>
which has remained by them to this day, to the
early vigorous education which those doughty
champions of old imparted to them, not by
preaching or advice, but by their own dauntless
example.</p>

<p>Can we wonder if their people&rsquo;s passionate
gratitude and unselfish admiration survived
those glorious men through ages? Can we
wonder if after centuries had come and gone
the memory of their deeds and persons appeared
to later generations through a halo of
wonder and awe?</p>

<p>Deeds of a remote past always assume gigantic
proportions. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; men would say,
&ldquo;surely, those heroes were more than ordinary
mortals! They had more than human strength,
endurance, wisdom. Neither iron fang nor
claw of steel could harm them. They died, indeed,
but of their nature they must have been
half divine; their mothers were human, but
surely the gods themselves were their fathers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thus it was settled, and for many, many
hundreds of years the Greeks continued to
honor their ancient heroes as half-divine men,
or demi-gods, and to erect altars to them and
come to them with prayers and offerings. The
Greek had to grow in mind and soul high
enough to grasp the truth that there can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xvi]</a></span>
only one God, and that no man, high as he may
tower above his kind, can be more than human.</p>

<p>But it was a beautiful and ennobling belief,
and at first sight it seems a pity that it was
ever lost, yet in reality it was a great gain, for
men may think they have an excuse for not
putting forth their bravest efforts if they believe
that the gods only can achieve deeds of
courage. There is no reason why men may
not aspire to any height of bravery which has
been gained by other men.</p>

<p>The undying energy embodied in the characters
of these old heroes is the inheritance of
every child. The children of America are not
born the sons of ruling houses. But they are
destined to be the guardians and rulers of their
native land. And if the children take into their
future lives the heroism they first realize in ancient
story, they will find themselves, when the
time comes, armed with the same courage, endurance,
and love of human beings which have
made the heroes of all lands and ages.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="chap01" id="chap01"></a>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="smlfont">THE BABE HERAKLES</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Far</span> away in the land of Argos there once
lived a beautiful maiden, the daughter of a
brave king. She was tall and fair and her
name was Alkmene. Her father was rich in
the possession of many oxen.</p>

<p>Her husband also owned great herds of
oxen. He had so many that he could not tell
them from those of the king. So he quarrelled
with the king and slew him. Then he took
Alkmene and fled from his native land. They
came to Thebes and made it their home.</p>

<p>Here Herakles was born, the babe who was
stronger than the strongest of men. The goddess,
Hera, hated Herakles. She was the wife
of Zeus, the Lord of Thunder and King of
Heaven. Hera was angry because Zeus loved
him, and she was jealous because Zeus had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
foretold that Herakles would become the
greatest of men. More than that Zeus had
deceived Hera and sent the infant Herakles to
her to be nursed that he might be made strong
and god-like by tasting divine milk.</p>

<p>So Hera sent two large snakes to devour the
babe when she found out what child it was
that she had fed. Herakles lay asleep in the
great brazen shield which his father carried in
battle, for he had no other cradle. The fearful
serpents crept up with open mouths into
the shield with the sleeping babe.</p>

<p>As soon as Alkmene saw them she was terribly
frightened and called in a loud voice for
help. His father, hearing the outcry of Alkmene,
ran into the house with his sword drawn
and a great many warriors came with weapons
in their hands.</p>

<p>Herakles was only eight months old, but before
his father could reach him he sat up in his
bed and seized the serpents by their necks
with his little hands. He squeezed and choked
them with such force that they died.</p>

<p>When Alkmene saw that the two snakes
were dead and that Herakles was safe, she rejoiced
greatly. But Hera&rsquo;s heart was filled
with wrath and she began to plan more mischief
against the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
Herakles had his free will as long as he was
a boy. His teachers were celebrated heroes
who taught him boxing, wrestling, riding, and
all kinds of games. He learned to read and
write and to hurl the spear and shoot with
bows and arrows. Linos taught him music.</p>

<p>Herakles had a violent temper, and one day
as Linos was teaching him to play the lute,
the good teacher had reason to punish him.
Herakles flew into a rage at this and struck
Linos and killed him. Then his father sent
him to the hills and left him to the care of
herdsmen.</p>

<p>The boy grew to be very large and strong.
While he was yet a youth he slew a lion of
great size that had killed many of his father&rsquo;s
cattle. He went home wearing the lion&rsquo;s
skin as a sign of his victory.</p>

<p>Because he was so brave the King of
Thebes gave his daughter to him in marriage
and he lived happily with her for many years.
But a sudden insanity came upon him during
which he mistook his wife and children for
wild beasts and shot them down with his bow
and arrows. When Herakles recovered from
his insanity and saw what he had done his
grief was boundless.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="smlfont">HERAKLES IS DOOMED TO SERVE EURYSTHEUS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wrath of Hera followed Herakles.
When Zeus saw that Hera&rsquo;s heart was filled
with anger toward Herakles, he mused within
his own mind how he might best appease her
resentment and protect the young man.</p>

<p>So he called the gods together in council and
they advised that Herakles be placed in bondage
to his uncle Eurystheus, to serve him as a
slave, and they ordained that he should perform
twelve hard tasks, after which he would
be numbered among the gods.</p>

<p>Eurystheus was a mean fellow, stupid and
cowardly. He was glad enough to have a
chance to bully a man wiser and stronger than
himself. He was born in Tiryns, a great fortress
with many castles, built upon a large rock,
but he had been made King of Argos and lived
in the capital, Myken&aelig;, and he resolved to keep
Herakles as far away from the kingdom as possible,
for in his heart he was afraid of him.</p>

<p>Herakles was grieved at being compelled to
serve a man so much below him in strength
and character, so he consulted the oracle at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
Delphi to see if there was any escape, but he
did not murmur, for he was willing to obey the
law of the gods.</p>

<p>The oracle of Delphi was a mysterious influence,
a divine spirit which expressed itself
through a priestess living in a sacred temple.
It was supposed to be the voice of the god
Apollo using this human agency for making
known his will to men. The priestess became
inspired to utter Apollo&rsquo;s holy laws by sitting
on a golden tripod (or stool with three legs)
over a chasm in the rock, from whence arose a
sacred, sulphurous vapor which she breathed
in as the breath of the god, and which caused
her to breathe out his commands in wonderful
sayings.</p>

<p>The chasm from which the vapor issued was
called The Chasm of the Oracle, and was in a
large apartment or room in the temple. This
celebrated temple had many columns of marble
and splendid rooms made beautiful with thousands
of marble statues. It stood on the side
of Mount Parnassos, whose snow-covered head
reaches into the clouds and looks down into
the blue Gulf of Corinth below it to the
south.</p>

<p>It was here that Apollo killed the great
dragon, Pytho, which had been the scourge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
the land for many years, and the grateful people
built the temple in his honor. The oracle
bade Herakles go forth to be the slave of Eurystheus
and so atone for all his sins, but it gave
him as a compensation a dear friend, Iolaos,
who was also his young nephew. Wherever
Herakles went Iolaos went with him and
helped him.</p>

<span class="smlfont">THE FIRST LABOR&mdash;THE NEMEAN LION</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> happened that a fearful lion lived in Nemea,
a wild district in upper Argolis, and it
devastated all the land and was the terror of
the inhabitants. Eurystheus ordered Herakles
to bring him the skin of this lion. So Herakles
took his bow, his quiver, and heavy club and
started out in search of the beast.</p>

<p>When he had reached a little town which is
in the neighborhood of Nemea he was kindly
received by a good countryman, who promised
to put him on the track of the lion if he would
sacrifice the animal to Zeus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;">

<p class="caption">THE PRIESTESS OF APOLLO AT DELPHI.<br />
(Michael Angelo.)</p>
</div>

<p>Herakles promised, and the countryman went
with him to show him the way. When they
reached the place where traces of the lion were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
seen, Herakles said to his guide: &ldquo;Remain
here thirty days. If I return safely from the
lion-hunt you must sacrifice a sheep to Zeus,
for he is the god who will have saved me. But
if I am slain by the lion you must sacrifice the
sheep to me, for after my death I shall be honored
as a hero.&rdquo; Having said this, Herakles
went his way.</p>

<p>He reached the wilderness of Nemea, where
he spent several days in looking for the lion,
but without success. Not a trace of him could
be found, nor did he fall in with any human
being, for there was no one bold enough to
wander around in that wilderness. Finally he
spied the lion as he was about to crawl into
his den.</p>

<p>The lion was indeed worthy of his terrible
fame. His size was prodigious, his eyes shot
forth flames of fire, and his tongue licked his
bloody chops. When he roared, the whole desert
resounded.</p>

<p>But Herakles stood fearlessly near a grove
from whence he might approach the lion, and
suddenly shot at him with his bow and arrow,
hitting him squarely in the breast. The arrow
glanced aside, and slipping around the lion&rsquo;s
neck, fell on a rock behind him. When Herakles
saw this he knew that the lion was proof
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
against arrows and must be killed in some other
way, and seizing his club, he gave chase to him.</p>

<p>The lion made for a cave which had two
mouths. Herakles closed up one of the entrances
with heavy rocks and entered the other.
He seized the lion by the throat and then came
a terrible struggle, but Herakles squeezed him
in his mighty arms until he gasped for breath,
and at last lay dead.</p>

<p>Then Herakles took up the huge body and,
throwing it easily over his shoulder, returned
to the place where he had left the countryman.
It was on the last of the thirty appointed days,
and the rustic, supposing that Herakles had
come to his death through the lion, was about
to offer up a sheep as a sacrifice in his honor.</p>

<p>He rejoiced greatly when he saw Herakles
alive and victorious, and the sheep was offered
up to Zeus. Herakles left the little town and
went to Myken&aelig; to the house of his uncle and
showed him the dead body of the terrible lion.
Eurystheus was so greatly frightened at the
sight that he hid himself within a tower whose
walls were built of solid brass.</p>

<p>And he ordered Herakles not to enter the
city again, but to stay outside of its gates until
he had performed the other labors.</p>

<p>Herakles stripped the skin from the lion with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
his fingers, although it was so tough, and knowing
it to be arrow-proof, took it for a cloak and
wore it as long as he lived.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="smlfont">THE SECOND LABOR&mdash;HERAKLES KILLS THE
WATER-SNAKE OF LAKE LERNA</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> far from Myken&aelig; is a small lake called
Lerna. It is formed from a large spring at the
foot of a hill. In this lake there lived a water-snake
called the Hydra. It was a snake of uncommon
size, with nine heads. Eight of the
heads were mortal, but the one in the middle
was immortal.</p>

<p>The Hydra frequently came out of the water
and swallowed up herds of cattle, laying waste
the surrounding country. Eurystheus ordered
Herakles to kill the snake, so he put on his
lion&rsquo;s skin, and taking his club, started out. He
mounted his chariot and took his faithful friend
Iolaos, who acted as charioteer.</p>

<p>Every warrior had to have a charioteer to
drive the horses, leaving him free to use both
of his hands. But driving was by no means the
charioteer&rsquo;s only duty; he had also to look out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
for danger and protect the warrior with his
shield as well as to supply him with arrows
from the quiver suspended at the side of every
chariot, and with reserve spears when his own
was broken in the fray.</p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that the warrior&rsquo;s life
was entirely in the hands of his charioteer, so it
is no wonder that only the hero&rsquo;s dearest and
most trusted friends were allowed to serve him
in this way.</p>

<p>After driving along for a while through
groves of olive-trees and past pleasant vineyards,
they came to wild places and saw Lake
Lerna gleaming through the trees. Having
reached the lake, Herakles descended from the
chariot, left the horses in care of Iolaos, and
went to hunt for the snake.</p>

<p>He found it in a swampy place where it was
hiding. Herakles shot some burning arrows
at the Hydra and forced it to come out. It
darted furiously at him, but he met it fearlessly,
put his foot upon its tail, and with his club began
to strike off its heads. He could not accomplish
anything in this way, for as fast as he
knocked off one head two others grew in its
place.</p>

<p>The snake coiled itself so firmly around one
of Herakles&rsquo; legs that he was no longer able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
stir from the place. Added to all this there
came a huge crab to the assistance of the snake.
It crept up to Herakles&rsquo; foot, and seizing it
with its sharp claws, inflicted painful wounds.
Herakles killed the crab with his club and
called Iolaos to help him.</p>

<p>Under Herakles&rsquo; directions Iolaos produced
a fire-brand which he applied to the neck as
fast as Herakles cut off one of the snake&rsquo;s
heads, in this way preventing them from growing
again. Finally it came the turn of the head
which could not die. Cutting it off Herakles
buried it in the ground, placing a heavy stone
over it.</p>

<p>Then he dipped some arrows into the Hydra&rsquo;s
blood, which was poisonous, so that whoever
was wounded by one of them could not
be healed. The least scratch inflicted by such
an arrow was incurable.</p>

<p>Eurystheus, of course, had no word of praise
for his great bondsman, but the people, knowing
that the place was now safe, flocked to the
land in great numbers and drained the lake,
which was really not much more than a big
marshy pond, and in their new homes they
blessed the hero&rsquo;s name forever. That was the
prize for which Herakles cared the most.</p>

<p>If you should go to-day to that old battle-field
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
of Herakles you would still find the spring
flowing from the rocks, but Lake Lerna exists
only in story.</p>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smlfont">THE THIRD LABOR&mdash;THE GOLDEN-HORNED HIND</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lower part of Greece is a most peculiar-looking
bit of country. You would think it had
been torn off from the bulk of the land but kept
hanging on to it by a small narrow strip. Then,
too, its shape is so queer that it has been compared
to all sorts of things; sometimes to a
mulberry leaf, sometimes to an open hand.</p>

<p>If we keep to the latter comparison, we will
find that the part which answers to the palm of
the hand is a large and intricate knot of high
wooded mountains which shoot out spurs in all
directions. These spurs with the land attached
to them stretch out into the sea as so many
small peninsulas and not badly represent the
fingers of the hand. The central knot of mountains
is even now different from the country all
around.</p>

<p>The people there are wilder, very much given
to robbery and violence and very slow to accept
new ways of life or improvements of any kind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
In the old heroic times of several thousand years
ago that country was simply an impassable wilderness.</p>

<p>It was overcrowded with wild beasts, among
which the bear must have been the most plentiful
since the land was named after him, Arcadia&mdash;the
land of Bears. Wolves were known also
to abound.</p>

<p>The men who had their villages in the narrow
valleys by the mountain-streams were fierce and
lawless. There was nothing for them to do but
to keep goats and hunt all day long. Arcadia
was truly the paradise of hunters and therefore
held as specially sacred to the beautiful huntress,
the goddess, Artemis&mdash;the Lady of the Chase.
She roamed over hills and valleys and through
woods and groves by moonlight to protect the
herds and flocks, this beautiful daughter of
Zeus.</p>

<p>In these same mountains of Arcadia there
roamed a lovely Hind sacred to Queen Artemis,
who gave her golden horns so that she might
be known from other deer by the huntsmen.
Thus they might be saved from the crime of
slaying what was sacred to the gods. Eurystheus
ordered Herakles to bring him the Hind
alive, for he did not dare to have her killed.</p>

<p>Herakles spent a whole year seeking her from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
the mountain-tops down to the valleys, through
tangles of brush, over streams and in forests,
but he was not able to catch her. After a long
chase he forced her at last to take refuge on the
side of a mountain and from that place to go
down to a river to drink.</p>

<p>In order that he might prevent the deer from
crossing the water, Herakles was obliged slightly
to wound one of her legs. Not till then was
he able to secure his game and carry it to
Eurystheus.</p>

<p>On his way to Myken&aelig; Herakles was met by
Artemis, who upbraided him for having captured
the Hind belonging to her. Herakles made
answer: &ldquo;Great Goddess, if I have chased and
caught thy deer, I did it out of necessity, not
impiety; for thou well knowest that the gods
ordered me to be a servant to Eurystheus and
he commanded me to catch the Hind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words he soothed the anger of the
goddess and brought the golden-horned Hind
to Myken&aelig;.</p>

<span class="smlfont">THE FOURTH LABOR&mdash;THE ERYMANTHIAN BOAR</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Elis</span> is a beautiful plain lying to the north
and west of Arcadia. Here once in five years
there was a great festival in honor of Zeus,
when all the men and boys ran races, wrestled,
boxed and played all sorts of games. Between
Arcadia and Elis there is a high mountain-range,
called Erymanthos. There a terrible
Boar had its lair.</p>

<p>The Boar frequently left its den and came
down into the plains and killed cattle, destroyed
fields of grain and attacked people.
Eurystheus, having heard of this Boar, made
up his mind that he wanted the beast alive, and
so ordered Herakles to bring it to him.</p>

<p>The hero put on his lion skin once more and
started for the mountain. On his way he
stopped at a little town where the Centaurs had
their home. These strange people were half
man and half horse. We have heard that they
were really men, but such good riders that they
seemed to be one with their mountain ponies.</p>

<p>Their home was just on the edge of a high
plain, covered with oak-trees and looking down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
across a wild valley, through which flowed the
Erymanthos River. There were many forests
and little streams and dreadful gorges in the
valley, where these horsemen used to hunt
and fish.</p>

<p>The Centaur Chief, Pholos, received Herakles
as a guest and gave him cooked meat to
eat, while he ate it raw himself, after the Centaurs&rsquo;
custom.</p>

<p>When Herakles had eaten his fill, he said to
Pholos: &ldquo;Thy food is indeed good and tasteful.
But I should enjoy it still more if I could
have a sip of wine, for I am very thirsty.&rdquo; To
which Pholos replied: &ldquo;My dear guest, we
have very fine and fragrant wine in this mountain,
and I should like nothing better than to
give thee some of it. But I am afraid to do so,
because it has a strong aroma, and the other
Centaurs, if they smelt it, might come to my
cave and want some. They are very fierce and
lawless, and might do thee great harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let not that trouble thee,&rdquo; said Herakles.
&ldquo;I am not afraid of the Centaurs.&rdquo; So the
wine was placed before him and he drank of it.
In a little while a great noise was heard outside
of the cave, a shouting of many wild
voices and a stamping of many horses&rsquo; feet.
What Pholos feared had come to pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
The Centaurs had smelt the fragrance of the
wine and in full armor had made for the cave
of Pholos. Then began a terrible fight. The
Centaurs fell upon Herakles with pine-branches,
rocks, axes, and fire-brands, and the clouds,
their mothers, poured a flood of water on him.
But Herakles was too clever for them. He put
two to flight, prevented others from entering
the cave, and shot the rest down with his arrows.</p>

<p>Pholos was a kind-hearted chief, and hearing
one of the Centaurs crying for help outside of
his cave, went out to him and tried to pull the
arrow from his wound, wondering at the same
time that so slight a weapon could cause his
death. But the arrow slipped out of his hand
and struck his own foot. It made only a
scratch, but it could not be healed, for the
arrow was one of those which Herakles had
dipped in the blood of the Hydra, and poor
Pholos breathed his last.</p>

<p>The death of his kind host was a great sorrow
to Herakles, for in those times, when there
was so little safety in travelling, the bond of
kindness and gratitude between host and guest
was one of the closest and most sacred, often
more so than that between members of the
same family. In all their later lives, host and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
guest could never meet as enemies, and if the
chances of war brought them face to face as
foes, they were not expected to fight. They
exchanged greetings and gifts and drove off in
different directions.</p>

<p>Herakles therefore sincerely mourned his
friend, performed over him the proper funeral
rites, and buried him with all due honors in the
side of the mountain. There he left him, sore
at heart, but comforted by knowing that he
had done all he could do to reconcile the shade
of Pholos, and that his soul would bear him no
grudge in Spirit Land.</p>

<p>Then Herakles went on his way in search of
the Boar. He soon spied him in a dense
thicket and chased him to the very top of the
mountain. The mountain-top was covered with
deep snow, which prevented the Boar from
running fast enough to escape. So Herakles
ran up to him, caught him in a net, threw him
over his shoulder and carried him off alive to
Myken&aelig;.</p>

<p>It is said that Eurystheus hid himself in a
large brazen bowl when he heard Herakles
approaching the city, and that Herakles threw
the Boar into the same brazen bowl as the
safest place in which to keep him. How astonished
Eurystheus must have been to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
himself in such terrible company! And we
can fancy that he scrambled out with all possible
haste.</p>

<span class="smlfont">THE FIFTH LABOR&mdash;HERAKLES CLEANS THE
AUGEIAN STABLES</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have already read about Elis, a plain in the
southwestern part of Greece, where all the people
used to worship Zeus and where they built
a wonderful temple in his honor. They built a
temple to Hera, his wife, also, and many other
temples which were filled with statues. What
a fine time you would have if you could only
go and see this beautiful land. Perhaps you
will some time.</p>

<p>The temples are in ruins now, and they cover
enough ground for a small town. The huge
blocks of marble lie on the ground just as they
fell, and there are the marble floors as people
used to see them two thousand years ago.
There is a high hill close to the ruins. It is
called the mountain of Kronos, &ldquo;Old Father
Time.&rdquo; Kronos is said to have been one of
the early kings of Elis and he was the father of
Zeus. He swallowed up his children when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
they were babes, if we care to believe what is
said of him, and the story could easily be true,
for Time swallows everything if he is only
long enough about it.</p>

<p>The strong men and the boys used to come
to Elis to have athletic games in honor of Zeus.
They ran races, they boxed, they shot arrows
and did all sorts of things to show how strong
they were. There are two rivers at the foot
of Mount Kronos, and beyond the rivers are
many low hills where people used to sit and
watch the games.</p>

<p>There was at one time a king of Elis, Augeias,
who was so rich in cattle that he hardly knew
what to do with them and consequently he built
a stable miles long and drove his cows into it.
He did this year after year and the herds kept
growing larger. He could not get men enough
to take care of his stables and the cows could
hardly get into them on account of the filth;
or if they did get in they were never sure of
getting out again because the dirt was piled so
high.</p>

<p>Eurystheus thought he had found a disagreeable
and impossible task for Herakles, and so
he ordered him to clean out the stables in one
day. Herakles told Augeias that he must clean
the barns and promised to do it in one day if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
he would give him one-tenth of all his cows.
The king thought Herakles would never be
able to do it in one day and readily promised
him in the presence of his son one-tenth of
the cows.</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s stables were close to the two
rivers, near Mount Kronos. Herakles cut
channels and sent the rivers running into the
stables. They rushed along and carried the
dirt out so quickly that the king was astonished.
He did not intend to pay the promised
reward and pretended that he never made any
such promise.</p>

<p>And he said he would have the matter come
before a court and the judges should decide it.
Then Herakles called the little prince as a
witness before the judges, and the boy told the
truth about it, which caused the king to fall
into such a rage that he sent both his son and
Herakles out of the country. Herakles left
the land of Elis and went back to Myken&aelig;.
But his heart was filled with contempt for the
faithless king.</p>

<span class="smlfont">THE SIXTH LABOR&mdash;THE BIRDS OF STYMPHALOS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the northern limit of Arcadia is a huge
cliff, over which pours a black ribbon of water.
At the bottom of the cliff it is lost among
piles of rocks. The water itself is not black,
but it appears so because the rock is covered
with black moss, and so the stream is called
the Styx or Black Water.</p>

<p>The Styx is icy cold and it runs along under
the ground so that it seems to belong to the
dead, and is called the River of Death. When
the gods used to make a promise which they
did not dare to break they said, &ldquo;I promise by
the Styx.&rdquo; This promise was called &ldquo;the Great
Oath of the Gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Farther on in the land of Arcadia there is a
vale called Stymphalos. It lies among the
mountains and is open to the storms of winter
and the floods of spring. And there are a lake
and a city both called Stymphalos. The people
of Athens hope to carry the water of this
lake to Athens by means of an underground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
channel. All about the lake are hills covered
with firs and plane-trees.</p>

<p>Lake Stymphalos was the home of a countless
number of birds which held noisy meetings
in the woods. They had iron claws and their
feathers were sharper than arrows. They
were so strong and fierce that they dared attack
men, and would tear them to pieces that
they might feast upon human flesh. They
bore a striking resemblance to the Harpies, and
were the terror of all the people who lived
near Stymphalos.</p>

<p>Eurystheus ordered Herakles to drive the
birds away. So Herakles took his bow and
quiver and went to the lake. But the forests
were so dense that he could not see the birds,
and he sat down to think of the best way to
drive them out. Suddenly the goddess of wisdom
came to him to help him.</p>

<p>The goddess gave him a huge rattle and told
him how to use it. Herakles went up on to the
highest mountain that lies near the lake and
shook the rattle with a will. The birds were
so frightened by the noise that they came out
of the thick wood where their nests were and
flew high up into the air.</p>

<p>Their heavy feathers fell like flakes in a driving
snow-storm. Herakles shot at the birds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
with his arrows. He killed a great many of
them and the rest were so scared that they
flew away and were never seen again at Stymphalos.</p>

<span class="smlfont">THE SEVENTH LABOR&mdash;HERAKLES CATCHES
THE MAD BULL OF CRETE</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is an island south of Greece which is
so large that it would take you from early morning
until late at night to sail past it. There are
high mountains all along the shore and they
look as if they were covered with snow. There
is a cave in one of the mountains where Zeus
was hidden when he was a babe so that his
father, Kronos, should not swallow him. The
nymphs fed him on honey and a famous goat
gave him milk.</p>

<p>The name of this island was Crete, and Minos
ruled there as king. It was his duty to sacrifice
to Poseidon, the God of the Sea, whatever came
up out of the water.</p>

<p>Minos was rich and greedy. He loved his
cattle better than the will of the gods. It came
to pass that a wonderful Bull rose from the sea
while Minos was king. When Minos saw him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
he admired the beauty of the animal so much
that he resolved to keep him. He drove the
Bull into his barn and sacrificed another to the
God of the Sea.</p>

<p>Poseidon grew angry with him and caused
the Bull to become mad so that no one dared to
approach him. Eurystheus ordered Herakles
to catch him and bring him to Myken&aelig;.</p>

<p>So Herakles went to Crete and begged Minos
to give him the Bull. The king told him that
he was entirely welcome to the Bull if he could
catch him. Herakles seized him by the horns
and bound his feet together and carried him off
to Myken&aelig;.</p>

<p>There he showed the mad animal to Eurystheus
and then set him free. The Bull wandered
off to Sparta and over the hills of
Arcadia and crossing the Isthmus, he reached
Marathon, where he left the land and swam off
into the sea.</p>

<span class="smlfont">THE EIGHTH LABOR&mdash;THE HORSES OF DIOMEDES</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Greece</span> was bounded on the north by a wild
and mountainous land, called Thrace. The
natives were not of Greek stock and remained
fierce, lawless, and cruel for a long time after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
Greece had become the most civilized of countries.
They were so quarrelsome and such
desperate fighters that their country was supposed
to be the favorite residence of the war
god, Ares.</p>

<p>The king who reigned in Thrace at the time
of Herakles was so much worse than the rest of
the people that he was said to be Ares&rsquo; own son,
and he was called the storm king. He was very
fond of horses and kept a breed of them after
his own heart. They were man-eating horses,
which he fed on the flesh of any strangers who
came to that country or that were wrecked on
the shore, thus breaking the most sacred laws
and making himself hated by men and gods.
The horses were blood-thirsty and so furious
that they had to be chained to their stalls.</p>

<p>Eurystheus commanded Herakles to bring
these horses to his stables in Myken&aelig;. This
time Herakles took several friends with him,
who helped him catch the horses and lead them
to the shore. Diomedes, having heard of the
robbery, started in pursuit with many armed
men.</p>

<p>Herakles and his friends went by sea. They
attacked the guards and led the horses down to
the ship. A terrible battle followed, in which the
wicked king was slain by Herakles, who threw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
him as food to the horses. The warriors who
helped Diomedes were put to flight and some
of Herakles&rsquo; best men were also killed. With
the rest he drove the horses into his ship and
brought them safely to Myken&aelig;.</p>

<p>Eurystheus, of course, had no intention of
keeping them in his stables and had them set
loose. They ran off into the forests of Arcadia
and were never seen again. It was thought
that they were devoured by the mountain
wolves.</p>

<span class="smlfont">THE NINTH LABOR&mdash;THE GIRDLE OF
HIPPOLYTE</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Eurystheus</span>, as we have seen, sent Herakles
a little farther every time in hopes of never
seeing him again. It would take you a whole
day going on the best steamer to get to Crete
from Athens, and in those days, when steamers
had not been thought of, the sailing must have
been slow indeed. Eurystheus now sent the
hero yet farther off to the Black Sea, on the
southern shore of which there lived the Amazons,
a nation of warlike women.</p>

<p>The Amazons were brought up like men.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
Their main occupation was war, and they were
excellent horsewomen. They were sharpshooters
with the bow and arrow. Hippolyte,
the queen of the Amazons, was a brave and
handsome woman. She wore a celebrated
girdle, the gift of Ares, as a sign of her queenly
rank.</p>

<p>Eurystheus had a daughter who had heard
of the beauty of the famous girdle which was
worn by the Amazon queen. She begged her
father to send Herakles to bring it to her.
Then Eurystheus ordered Herakles to fetch the
girdle, and he manned a ship and sailed away,
taking several companions with him.</p>

<p>After many wanderings they reached the
Black Sea and sailed to the Amazon country.
Queen Hippolyte was at once informed that
some strangers had arrived from a far-off land,
and she came down to the shore to learn why
they had come. Herakles told her that a princess
had sent him to get the girdle given her
by Ares. Hippolyte admired the bold hero for
his frankness and promised that she would give
it to him.</p>

<p>But Hera changed herself into an Amazon
and rushing into the midst of an army of them
cried out, &ldquo;The strangers are carrying off our
queen!&rdquo; Then all the Amazons snatched up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
their arms and rushed on horseback to the ship.
When Herakles saw them coming armed to attack
his men, he thought Hippolyte had betrayed
him and he slew her and took her girdle.</p>

<p>Then he attacked the rest of the Amazons
and put them to flight. When the battle was
over, Herakles and his companions went on
board the ship and sailed for home.</p>

<p>Soon after they had started on their way to
Myken&aelig; they found Hesione, the daughter of
La&ouml;medon, on the shore chained to a rock.
La&ouml;medon was at that time king of Troy, and
Herakles and his companions stopped to find
out why the daughter of a great king had to
suffer such a terrible punishment. She told
Herakles that Apollo, the sun god, and Poseidon,
the god of the sea, once took on the form
of man and began to build walls around the
city of Troy. Her father promised to aid
them but neglected to keep his promise. This
conduct made the gods indignant and Apollo
sent a pestilence to rage in the city while
Poseidon sent a sea-monster which came up
out of the ocean and devoured the people.</p>

<p>La&ouml;medon asked the priest of Apollo how he
might appease the wrath of the gods. The
priest answered that the city would be freed
from the double plague if La&ouml;medon would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
chain his daughter to the rock on the shore
where the monster might devour her.</p>

<p>La&ouml;medon obeyed the oracle and had her
chained to the cliff near the sea. Just then
Herakles arrived and stopped near the shore,
when La&ouml;medon with hot tears entreated him
to save his daughter. Herakles promised to do
it under the condition that La&ouml;medon should
give him as a reward a famous horse in his
possession.</p>

<p>Herakles killed the sea-monster, but La&ouml;medon
again did not keep his promise and Herakles
left Troy, his heart filled with scorn for
the faithless king. On his return to Myken&aelig;
he gave the girdle of the Amazon queen to his
cousin, the daughter of Eurystheus.</p>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="smlfont">THE TENTH LABOR&mdash;THE CATTLE OF GERYON</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Iberia</span>, now called Spain, lies at the farthest
end of Europe, and beyond it, in the Atlantic, is
an island which was once the home of Geryon,
a famous giant. His body was as large around
as three other men&rsquo;s bodies put together. He
had three heads and three pairs of legs and six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
arms. He had huge wings also and carried
dangerous weapons.</p>

<p>Geryon was the lord of many herds of cattle.
He had one herd of red oxen, as red as
the sky at the setting of the sun, and they were
guarded by a trusty herdsman and a fierce two-headed
dog. Eurystheus ordered Herakles to
bring the cattle to Myken&aelig;.</p>

<p>Herakles having overcome numberless difficulties,
wandering through wild deserts and
unknown lands, finally reached the open ocean,
the end of all. There he erected as a monument
two pillars opposite each other, one on
the African shore, and one in Europe. These
were called the Pillars of Herakles in those
days, but now they are known as the Rocks of
Ceuta and Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Helios, the Sun, admiring the bravery of
Herakles, lent him his golden skiff, shaped like
a cup. Helios always sailed round the world
every night from west to east in this cup, and
Herakles, although he feared a storm, took his
place in the strange boat and started for the
island where Geryon tended his red cattle.
The world, as the Greeks saw it, was in the
form of a great plate, and the ocean was a river
surrounding it as the rim surrounds the plate.</p>

<p>When the two-headed dog saw Herakles he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
rushed at him with fury, and the herdsman also
attacked him at the same time. Herakles slew
them both with his club, took the cattle and
fled toward the boat. Then Geryon sprang
upon him and forced him to fight for his life.
They had a dreadful battle, in which Herakles
drew his bow and shot at the giant with one of
his deadly arrows and Geryon died.</p>

<p>Herakles at once drove the oxen down to
the boat, and after a safe voyage landed them
in Iberia. Then he started for home on foot,
driving his cattle northward over the Pyrenees
into Gaul or France. Here he was attacked
by hundreds of people who wanted to rob him
of his cattle.</p>

<p>Herakles shot at them with his arrows and
killed great numbers, and they stoned him
in return with large stones. Herakles would
have lost the battle but Zeus sent down a
shower of rocks of vast size, and Herakles
hurled them at his foes, driving them away
like frightened sheep. These enormous rocks
are still to be seen in the south of France.</p>

<p>After this adventure Herakles drove his cattle
over the Alps and down into Italy across
the Tiber, and they came to the Seven Hills of
Rome. In one of these hills there was a cave,
the home of a lawless giant named Cacus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
He was a creature of iron strength, and was
hideously ugly. He breathed out fire and
smoke, often killing people in this way, and
everybody in all the country about feared him.
Cacus saw Herakles coming with his cattle
over the river and among the hills, and he determined
to steal the cattle and hide them in
his den.</p>

<p>So when Herakles was asleep and the cattle
were grazing quietly, Cacus slipped out of his
cave and, seizing great numbers of them by the
tails, dragged them backward into the cavern
that their tracks might point away from the
cave and not toward it. When Herakles awoke
he missed his cattle and began to look for
them. He found their tracks and went in the
direction they seemed to point out, getting
farther and farther from their place of hiding.
The oxen bellowed, and their noises were muffled
by the rocks of the cavern, but Herakles
heard them and returned to the Seven Hills.
Listening intently he traced them to the right
hill, but Cacus had braced a stone slab against
the opening and it could not be moved from
the outside.</p>

<p>Herakles went around to the other side of
the hill and, tearing the stones away, forced a
new entrance. He sprang into the cave and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
seized the terrible monster by the throat. Cacus
blew flames into the hero&rsquo;s face and tried
to burn him to death, but Herakles held on and
strangled the giant to death. A volume of
black smoke came from his mouth and a stream
of melted lead as he fell back dead. Herakles
tore the slab from the door of the cave and
threw the body of Cacus out on the hill, and
all the people came to see it and rejoice that
their foe was slain. And they built an altar to
Herakles and instituted games to be held every
year in his honor.</p>

<p>Herakles left the Seven Hills and drove his
cattle southward. Being tired, he lay down
to rest on a mountain near Locri, and the grasshoppers
came around him singing in such shrill
tones that he could not sleep. He prayed to
the gods to drive them away, and the gods
swept them out of that region so that they
never came back.</p>

<p>One of the wild oxen ran away to the southwest
and escaped to an island. Herakles followed,
driving the whole herd over to the island.
The cattle swam across, and Herakles,
sitting on the back of one of the oxen and holding
on by its horns, was safely taken over. He

time through the island, enjoying the fresh

water of the springs and the kindness of the
people. Then he drove his cattle back to Italy
and passed up the shores of the Ionian Sea.</p>

<p>But Hera sent gadflies to make the cattle
wilder than they were before, and they scattered
over the mountain-heights as clouds are
scattered by a hot wind. They fled far to the
east, until they came to Thrace. There Herakles
gathered together as many as he could
and brought them to Myken&aelig;, where Eurystheus
sacrificed them to Hera.</p>

<span class="smlfont">THE ELEVENTH LABOR&mdash;THE GOLDEN APPLES
OF HESPERIDES</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the wedding between Zeus and Hera
was celebrated all the gods brought presents.
Mother Earth brought some apple-trees as her
gift. These trees bore precious golden apples,
and Zeus and Hera were so pleased with their
wonderful wedding-present that they appointed
four maidens, called the Daughters of the
West, to guard the apples, and also they placed
a dragon there with a hundred heads, who
never slept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
The fruit was so inviting that even the maidens
would have been tempted to eat it if the
terrible dragon had not kept close to the tree.
A roar like thunder came out of each of his
hundred mouths and frightened everything
away that dared approach the trees, and lightning
darted from his eyes to strike down intruders.</p>

<p>The trees grew more and more beautiful
from year to year, and the apples were so
heavy that the boughs bent beneath the golden
load. They grew in the Garden of the Hesperides,
in islands way off to the west, and
were watered by springs of nectar which had
their rise near the throne of Zeus.</p>

<p>Eurystheus had heard of the apples and he
ordered Herakles to bring them to him. For
a long time Herakles wandered about in various
lands until he came to the river Rhone,
where the water-goddesses or nymphs advised
him to ask counsel from the ancient lord of the
deep sea, who knew all the secrets of the ocean
depths and whose wisdom was beyond that of
the gods. He is called by many names, but
his gentlest name is Nereus, and he does not
like to be questioned unless he can take any
shape he pleases.</p>

<p>He usually escapes intruders, but to those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
who are not afraid and who manage to grasp
and to hold him, he freely opens the store of
his wisdom. This was what Herakles did.
Nereus took on the form of a lion, a serpent,
a fish, a stream of water, and at last, of an old
man, but Herakles held him close and learned
from him the road to the Garden of the Hesperides.</p>

<p>Leaving Nereus, Herakles travelled south into
Africa, where he met Ant&aelig;os, a huge giant who
lived in the desert. Ant&aelig;os was a son of Earth
and Ocean, and he was as strong as the terrible
sand-storms. He was cruel to all travellers
who crossed his domains and slew them, but
he loved and protected the tiny Pygmies that
lived all around him. No one had ever been
able to vanquish him in battle, for Mother
Earth gave him new strength and vigor every
time he lay down or touched the ground.</p>

<p>Herakles wrestled with him and threw him
down many times, but Ant&aelig;os sprang up
stronger than ever. At last Herakles caught
him up with one hand, and holding him high in
the air where he could not receive help from
Mother Earth, squeezed him to death.</p>

<p>Herakles was tired out with this tremendous
exertion and lay down in the desert to
rest. But he did not sleep long, for a whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
army of the little people, seeing their beloved
giant lying dead, came with their weapons to
attack Herakles. He found himself covered
with them from head to foot. He sprang up, and
quickly gathering up his lion&rsquo;s skin, crushed a
multitude of the Pygmies and killed them.</p>

<p>Then he hurried away toward the east,
going through many countries until he came
to India, and finding himself travelling in the
wrong direction, turned to the north and west
and came to the Caucasus Mountains. Here
he found Prometheus chained to the rocks of a
high mountain-peak. Prometheus had taught
mankind the use of fire and how to build
houses and had otherwise interfered with the
work of the gods, thereby bringing this punishment
upon himself. Herakles took pity on
him and set him free. In return for this kindly
act Prometheus told him the most direct
way to the Garden of the Hesperides, which
was through Scythia and the region of the
Hyperboreans at the back of the North Wind.</p>

<p>On his way Herakles stopped to visit Atlas,
who as a punishment for once having rebelled
against the gods was obliged to carry the
heavens on his shoulders. &ldquo;Let me relieve
thee for awhile, friend Atlas,&rdquo; said Herakles,
after greeting him in a most cordial manner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let me take the heavens on my shoulders and
I will let thee do me a great service in return.
I must have the Golden Apples that grow in
the Garden of the Hesperides to take to Eurystheus,
and thou canst bring them to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Atlas gladly placed the heavy firmament on
Herakles&rsquo; shoulders and took his way to the
Garden. There he contrived to put the many-headed
dragon to sleep and then slay him.
Taking possession of the Golden Apples, he
returned with them to Herakles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank thee very much, friend Atlas,&rdquo;
said Herakles. &ldquo;Take thy place again and
give me the apples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I have borne the weight of the
heavens for a long time,&rdquo; answered Atlas.
&ldquo;Thou hadst better keep my place and I will
carry the Golden Apples to Eurystheus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herakles was taken aback at this reply and
began to consider how he might escape from
this unexpected dilemma. At last he spoke.
&ldquo;Very well, I will willingly remain in thy
place, friend Atlas,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One thing only
I must first ask of thee. Take the heavens
back just for a moment while I get a pad to
put on my head so that the weight may not
hurt it. Otherwise the heavens will fall and
crush us both.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
Poor, simple old Atlas agreed to this, and
putting the Golden Apples on the ground he
again took the firmament on his shoulders.
Herakles picked up the apples and went off
saying, &ldquo;We must not bear malice toward
each other, friend Atlas. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this he departed and hastened back to
Myken&aelig;.</p>

<span class="smlfont">THE TWELFTH LABOR&mdash;HERAKLES FETCHES
CERBERUS OUT OF HADES</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to the terms of the doom that
was laid upon Herakles, the performance of
the last task was to free him from Eurystheus.
Eleven were now fulfilled and the tyrant&rsquo;s heart
failed him when he thought of what he might
expect at the hands of the hero he had used so
ill when once he was free from his power.</p>

<p>Cowards always fear those whom they have
ill-treated, so he determined to send Herakles
on an errand from which he thought he could
not possibly return. He had come back unharmed
from every known and unknown country
on the face of the earth, but who was ever
known to return alive from the land of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
dead? So Eurystheus as a last task ordered
him to go down to Hades and bring out alive
Cerberus, the three-headed dog that guards the
entrance to the lower world, feeling sure that
Herakles would remain forever in Hades.</p>

<p>Cerberus was a terrible monster. Besides
having three heads, he had a tail which ended
in a serpent&rsquo;s head, and all along his spine he
had serpents&rsquo; heads instead of hair. His duty
was to see that no dead should escape from
Hades after once entering its gates.</p>

<p>There was a long dark cave leading down to
Hades and the river Styx flowed across it. A
white-haired old ferryman, Charon by name,
waited with his boat on the shore to carry
the spirits of all who died. There they were
met by Minos, the great judge, who told them
whether they could go into the fields of the
Blessed or whether they were doomed to the
region of the Unhappy. Charon&rsquo;s boat was
but a delicate skiff and adapted only to carrying
souls without bodies, so Herakles was not
a welcome passenger.</p>

<p>Herakles found his way into Hades in spite
of all the difficulties, and presenting himself to
Pluto, the King of the Dead, begged him to
give him the Dog.</p>

<p>Pluto replied: &ldquo;Take him and lead him out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
into the world and thou shalt have him. But
thou must not use any weapon.&rdquo; Herakles
answered, &ldquo;I will use no weapon but my hands,
and with them alone I will conquer him.&rdquo;
Wearing his breastplate and clad in the lion&rsquo;s
skin he approached Cerberus, who stood on
guard at the gates. He threw his arms around
the Dog&rsquo;s three heads and pressed them with
all his might. The Dog fought with great fury,
and bit him with the snake&rsquo;s mouth which he
had at the end of his tail. Herakles threw his
lion&rsquo;s skin over the head of the Dog and
dragged him out by another gate into the daylight.
Cerberus had never seen the light of
the sun and was frightened beyond measure.
He foamed at the mouth, and wherever the
foam fell upon the ground it caused a poisonous
plant to grow.</p>

<p>Herakles took Cerberus to Eurystheus, who
was not pleased to see the Dog or the Hero.
Then he carried him back to Hades and restored
him to Pluto, and so were the twelve
great labors ended.</p>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="smlfont">THESEUS, THE HERO OF ATHENS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> land of Attica is very different from
Arcadia. It was cleared at a much earlier time
than the southern part of Greece, which could
be done the more easily as the soil being
naturally rather barren was not covered with
the thick, bristling forests which there sheltered
so many dangerous animals, and made it
such hard work for the peasants to clear the
smallest patch of farm.</p>

<p>Then, although the land offers but scanty
pasture for cattle and bears but few kinds of
trees and crops, it happens that those which it
does bear are the very ones that were the
greatest favorites with Greek farmers&mdash;the
olive and the vine. Besides which, being a
peninsula, and therefore almost entirely surrounded
by the sea, fish and other sea-food
was very plentiful, and trade with more or less
distant neighbors very easy.</p>

<p>Attica has no very high mountains, but those
that there are supply the country with beautiful
marbles, both white and colored. The people,
having such lovely material within reach,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
became from the earliest times the most skilful
of builders. Their Acropolis, for which nature
itself supplied them with a beautiful, tall
rock, of bright-colored stone, soon became
their greatest pride. It was the envy of their
neighbors, because of the splendid marble
palaces and temples which they could raise
there at so little cost.</p>

<p>The city which grew up at the foot of the
Acropolis was named Athens, after the goddess
of wisdom and cunning craft, Athena, the
favorite daughter of Zeus. It is clear from this
that the Athenians considered themselves more
civilized and in every way superior to the other
Greeks. Indeed, they were all that, and even
as far back as the heroic times their city began
to be famous above others.</p>

<p>In this favored land of Attica, at the same
time that Herakles astonished the world with
his miraculous deeds, there reigned a king,
&AElig;geus, who, having no child to succeed him
on the throne, was grieved at heart. So &AElig;geus
went to Delphi to consult the Oracle, and the
priestess told him that he should go to Tr&oelig;zene,
where he would find a beautiful and gentle
wife, the Princess &AElig;thra, daughter of Pittheus,
the King of Tr&oelig;zene. And the Oracle
promised that his wife should bear him a son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
whose name would become famous over all the
world.</p>

<p>So &AElig;geus took his way to Tr&oelig;zene, where
he found Pittheus, the wise old king, who received
him hospitably and gave him his daughter,
&AElig;thra, in marriage. &AElig;geus grew very
fond of his wife, but after awhile he had to
think of returning to his own kingdom, which
he could not leave to itself forever. &AElig;thra&rsquo;s
father was old and feeble, and she did not like
to leave him to the care of slaves; so &AElig;geus
agreed to let her stay with him.</p>

<p>But before &AElig;geus departed he took &AElig;thra
to an out-of-the-way place and dug a pit in
which he hid his sword and sandals. Then he
rolled a large stone over the pit and said to his
wife: &ldquo;Listen, &AElig;thra; take good care of the
son which the gods are about to send us, but
do not tell him who his father is. When he
has grown to be a youth, bring him to this
spot, and if he is able to lift the stone, let him
take the sword and the sandals and come to
me with them.&rdquo; After saying these words,
&AElig;geus kissed his wife, and bidding her an affectionate
farewell, returned to Athens.</p>

<p>When Theseus was born, &AElig;thra rejoiced
greatly, and brought him up with great care,
as she had promised &AElig;geus she would do.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
He was the pride of his grandfather&rsquo;s court,
and the good old king had him trained in all
kinds of games and athletic exercises and in
the use of the lyre. When he had grown up,
&AElig;thra led him to the rock, and after having
told him the name of his father, she said to
him: &ldquo;My son, lift up this heavy stone. You
will find under it what your father left for you.
Take his gift and go to Athens with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Theseus, without any difficulty, raised the
stone with his strong arms, and &AElig;thra hung his
father&rsquo;s sword over his shoulder and tied the
sandals to his feet. Then Theseus was ready to
set out for Athens. &AElig;thra advised him to go
by sea. It was the quickest and safest way.
The woods by land were everywhere full of
dangers from wild beasts and wicked men.</p>

<p>But Theseus, having heard of the great deeds
of Herakles and envying the fame of the hero,
said: &ldquo;Herakles was set the task to destroy the
wicked and to cleanse the land and sea from
evil-doers; and so I will not shirk tasks which
lie under my very feet and I will not shame my
father, fleeing ingloriously over the sea, where I
can perform no noble deeds by which I might
prove myself a worthy son to him, and do honor
to my mother&rsquo;s wisdom in bringing me up in
the way she has done.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
Theseus kissed his mother and grandfather
and started on his journey by land. The worst
part of his road lay across the Isthmus of
Corinth, which was so narrow that it gave little
chance for escape.</p>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="smlfont">THE FIRST EXPLOITS OF THESEUS. HE FINDS
HIS FATHER</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the northwest of Tr&oelig;zene is a tongue of
land projecting into the &AElig;gean Sea. In ancient
times the town of Epidauros was situated upon
it, and the temple, where Asklepios, the God of
Healing, was worshipped, stood near by. It
was a wild country whose hills were covered
with trees and shrubs&mdash;the hiding-place of lawless
robbers, the boldest of whom was named
Periphetes. He was also called Korynetes,
and he used an iron crown for a weapon, and
with it he smashed the heads of travellers.</p>

<p>Periphetes put himself in Theseus&rsquo; way and
would not let him go on. But the youth grappled
with him, and taking his iron crown from
him, crushed him to death with it. Theseus
carried the crown as his own particular weapon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
just as Herakles wore the skin of the Nemean
lion.</p>

<p>The most cruel of all the robbers lived a few
miles farther to the north, on the Isthmus of
Corinth, and his name was Sinis. He was called
the Tree-bender, because he used to bend together
two young pines. Then he would tie a
man by a leg and arm to each tree and let the
trees spring back, tearing the poor wretch to
pieces. Theseus punished this malefactor by
giving him the same treatment that he gave to
others, and the people of the Isthmus were so
grateful that they started a festival, called the
Isthmian Games, to be held in honor of the hero
every year.</p>

<p>On to the north went Theseus. He slew a
man-eating boar at Krommyon, which had long
terrified the people of that district. Coming
among the wild cliffs near the sea in Megaris,
he heard of the cruel giant Skiron, who used
to lie in wait for travellers. This evil-doer compelled
those who fell into his power to wash his
feet. This task performed, he flung the unlucky
traveller into the sea.</p>

<p>When Theseus passed his den Skiron ordered
him to wash his feet, and Theseus answered:
&ldquo;To tell the truth, friend Skiron, thy demand
is too small. I would willingly do more for thee.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
Not only are thy feet in need of a bath but so
is thy whole body. The sea is near and I will
give thee a thorough washing.&rdquo; And he seized
Skiron around the body and flung him over the
rocks into the breakers. From that time until
to-day the rocks are called the Skironian Cliffs.</p>

<p>A little farther on Theseus came upon another
famous robber known far and near as the
Stretcher, Korydallon, or Prokrustes. This
robber used to force the wayfarer to lie down
on a bed which was always too long or too
short for him. If the traveller proved too tall
for the bed, Prokrustes would cut off his feet
and legs to make him short enough to fit it.
But if the traveller were too short for the
bed, he would have him stretched until his feet
touched the foot-board. Prokrustes invited
Theseus to try the bed, but Theseus answered
him: &ldquo;Thou shalt try it first, friend Prokrustes,
and I will try it after thee.&rdquo; Then Prokrustes
was compelled to lie down in the bed,
which was much too short for him, and Theseus
cut off his head and his feet to make him fit the
bed, as the cruel Stretcher had done to so
many hapless strangers. Theseus exterminated
a great many more cruel robbers who had
made the roads to Athens unsafe, and the glory
of his deeds went on before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
Theseus, having performed these brave deeds,
reached Athens; but the rougher class, seeing a
stranger who wore a garb of a different fashion
from their own, scoffed at him, as is the custom
of vulgar people. His hair was long and his
form slender, so they called him a girl and told
him that he ought to take his nurse with him to
protect him. As he walked along among these
coarse people he came to a wagon heavily laden.
He took up the wagon with its load and tossed
it high in the air as easily as he would toss a ball,
much to the astonishment of his tormentors.</p>

<p>Theseus having come to the king&rsquo;s palace
in Athens, at once presented himself before
&AElig;geus. But he did not immediately make
himself known as his son. When he was called
to the table as a guest he drew his sword as if
he wanted to eat the meat with it, and &AElig;geus
recognized him as his son and received him
with joy and affection. Calling together the
citizens he proclaimed Theseus his son and
successor.</p>

<p>The citizens had heard of his heroic exploits,
and acknowledged him heir to the throne amid
general rejoicings. Only the nephews of &AElig;geus
were sorry that Theseus had appeared in their
midst. They had hoped to inherit the kingdom
after their uncle&rsquo;s death, believing that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
had no children. But now that Theseus came
among them as a successor to the throne, they
rebelled.</p>

<p>Theseus was brave and strong enough to
defend his father and himself. He fought the
rebels one after another and killed them. These
victories increased his glory greatly and won
him the hearts of the people of Athens.</p>

<span class="smlfont">THE ADVENTURES OF THESEUS</span></h2>
</div>


<h3><i>I. The Marathonian Bull</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Theseus</span> was too active to love an idle life
and began to look around him to find ways of
helping his father&rsquo;s people. He wanted to be
worthy of the throne. &ldquo;It is not enough,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;that I am of royal descent. I should also
have a royal heart and be of real service to mankind.
I must be a leader in deeds as well as in
words.&rdquo; He soon found an opportunity to show
his prowess.</p>

<p>To the northeast of Athens is a beautiful
mountain-ridge with a white marble band
across it. This is the famous Pentelikon, and
the purple mountain of Hymettos is separated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
from it by a narrow pass. Beyond these mountains
is the plain of Marathon sloping down to
the blue sea. In the plain of Marathon the
terrible Bull which Herakles had brought from
Crete to Eurystheus still roamed, but the tyrant
had turned it loose. This Bull did great
havoc among the inhabitants of the surrounding
country.</p>

<p>Theseus heard of their distress and promised
to free them from the fearful beast. He armed
himself with a tough shield and a long spear
and went to Marathon. When he found out the
Bull&rsquo;s hiding-place he chased and overtook him.
He grappled him by the horns with his powerful
hands and dragged him back to Athens.
The people of Athens and all the country about
came to meet Theseus. They rejoiced because
he had rid them of such a pest and they admired
his strength, but they did not dare to
help him, and stood ready to run for their lives
in case the Bull should slip away from him.
Theseus went through the midst of the city
holding on to the Bull, which he took to the
temple of Apollo and offered up as a sacrifice
to that god. Old &AElig;geus shed tears of joy
when he saw how the gods honored him in the
possession of such a son.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>II. Theseus Sails to Crete</i></h3>

<p>But there was a greater adventure with
greater glory awaiting Theseus, for Athens
had a more terrible enemy than the mad Bull of
Marathon. It had happened years before that
a son of Minos, the wise and powerful King of
Crete, had come to Athens to take part in the
yearly festival held in honor of the goddess
Athena. He took part in all their public games
and came off victor every time. The athletes
of Athens were very angry that a man from
another country should show more skill and
carry off all the prizes, so with &AElig;geus&rsquo; consent
they killed him.</p>

<p>Then Minos made war on the Athenians and
killed a great number of them, and the gods
also punished them for this treacherous murder
by letting the land bear no crops and by sending
on them a deadly fever.</p>

<p>The Athenians were compelled to surrender
to Minos, and they had to agree to the most
humiliating terms. They promised to send
seven youths and seven maidens every year
to Crete.</p>

<p>Now Minos had a park laid out by the most
cunning man of his times. There were walks
and paths so many and so winding that no one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
who got into it could get out again, but had to
wander on and on, getting more and more confused.
This park was called the Labyrinth, and
in the centre of it was a cave in which just at
that time King Minos kept a dangerous monster
which had the body and limbs of a man but the
head of a bull.</p>

<p>The creature was called the Minotaur and it
was fierce and cruel. There was only one way
to prevent him from roaming the fields and endangering
the lives of the people. He had to
be kept in a good humor, and this could be done
only by feeding him now and then on human
flesh. So Minos bethought him of using the
Athenian captives for that purpose.</p>

<p>When the time of the third tribute arrived,
the citizens of Athens began to urge &AElig;geus to
do something to prevent the dreadful sacrifice.
They accused him of being the sole cause of
the trouble. They told him that it was shameful
that he had no share in the punishment.
These complaints wounded the ambitious Theseus
to the quick.</p>

<p>His sense of justice told him that it would
be only right for him to share the troubles of
the citizens, and therefore he insisted on going
to Crete with the seven youths and the seven
maidens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
The citizens felt sorry for Theseus, and
&AElig;geus prayed his son to remain at home with
him, but Theseus answered: &ldquo;My dear father,
how can I be happy when the whole nation
suffers? How can I abide in safety when our
subjects are sacrificed? Do not try to dissuade
me, for honor calls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vessel which was to take them to Crete
was ready to start. It carried a black sail, a
sign of its direful errand. Theseus tried to console
his father by telling him that he was going
to kill the Minotaur. &AElig;geus was quick to believe
in the valor of his son and gave another
sail, a white one, to the pilot, telling him to hoist
it if they returned happily, but to leave the
black one up if Theseus failed to win the victory.
The ship sailed away and the parents and
relatives of the youths and maidens wept bitter
tears, but all the citizens called aloud to the
gods to give Theseus success in his generous
undertaking.</p>

<span class="smlfont">THE ADVENTURES OF THESEUS</span></h2>
</div>


<h3><i>III. Theseus Kills the Minotaur</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ship reached Crete and Minos ordered
the weeping youths and maidens to be thrown
into the den of the Minotaur and Theseus
with them. By a lucky chance Ariadne, the
daughter of the king, saw Theseus and was
moved with pity and a wish to save him. She
slyly gave him a ball of yarn and told him to
fasten one end of it to the inside entrance to
the Labyrinth and then wind it off as he
walked along that he might find his way back
again.</p>

<p>Theseus took the ball and went with his
companions into the Labyrinth. He fastened
one end of the thread firmly to the inside of
the entrance, and as he walked along the thread
caught and held on to the bushes. They could
hear the bellowing of the Minotaur as they
approached the cave, and the companions of
Theseus hid themselves in the bushes, trembling
with fright. But Theseus approached
fearlessly, and rushing upon the Minotaur,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
thrust his sword through him and the monster
fell dead.</p>

<p>The youths and maidens came out from their
hiding-places, and surrounding Theseus, kissed
his hands and called him their preserver.
Theseus, guided by the thread which Ariadne
had given him, led his companions safely to
the entrance of the Labyrinth. And when
they were free from its entanglements, Theseus
gratefully raised up his hands to heaven and
offered a prayer of thanks to the gods for their
escape.</p>

<p>Theseus and the companions whom he had
saved reached the sea-shore unhindered, hurried
their vessel into the water, unfurled the
sail, and rowed with all their might in order
to escape as quickly as possible from Crete
and return to their own beloved country. The
wind was favorable and the vessel cut through
the sea like a swan. They passed through the
midst of the islands of the sea and first landed
at Delos, the home of the god, Apollo. This
beautiful land was like a floating star and was
said to be surrounded by a wall of pure gold.</p>

<p>Theseus offered a sacrifice to Apollo and
danced with the youths and maidens a dance
in which they represented the winding passages
of the Labyrinth. But in their great joy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
neither he nor the pilot thought of unfurling
the white sail. Old &AElig;geus came every day to
the sea-shore to watch for the return of the
ship. There he sat on a high cliff and gazed
over the wide waters; he hoped to see the
boat coming with the white sail hoisted, and
was in great agony of mind for fear he should
see it coming with the black sail up.</p>

<p>At last he espied, one day, a ship coming
from afar. The nearer it came the greater
grew the old king&rsquo;s anxiety. Soon he recognized
the boat. It was the one which had
borne away his beloved Theseus. But alas!
the ship still carried the black sail, the sign of
sorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son is dead!&rdquo; exclaimed the unhappy
king. &ldquo;My only son is dead! My beloved
Theseus!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grief of &AElig;geus was beyond bounds and
his reason left him. In despair he threw himself
from the cliff into the sea and was drowned,
and from that time all that water has been
called the &AElig;gean Sea.</p>

<p>The ship entered the port near Athens and
Theseus brought the thanksgiving offerings
which he had promised the gods when he left
the port, and he sent a herald into the city to
announce their safe return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
The Athenians, as soon as they learned that
Theseus and the seven youths and seven maidens
had returned safely, hastened to the palace,
men, women, and children, and received him
with joy and honors. But Theseus&rsquo; pleasure
changed to grief when he learned that his
father had died on account of his great love
for his son.</p>

<p>The Athenians led him forth, however,
amidst the greatest demonstrations of enthusiasm
and proclaimed him their king. Thus
Theseus became King of Athens not only because
he was of royal descent but because
he was manly and loved his country better
than himself. The court of Theseus became
celebrated for its splendor and he ruled with
prudence. The villages of the plain of Attica
had formerly been at war with each other.
Now they united under one government, with
Athens as the chief city. Theseus founded
festivals and encouraged education, and was in
every way a good and wise leader.</p>

<p>Long after his death there was a beautiful
temple erected in his honor, and it stands in
Athens to this day. The stories of his great
deeds are carved in its stones, which are much
worn by time. There you can see the hero
slaying Prokrustes, Skiron, the Minotaur, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
Periphetes. And you can see the capture of
the wild Bull of Marathon. There, too, are the
stories of Herakles, in stone, as he slew the
lion and hydra and performed other valiant
deeds.</p>

<p>We speak of these heroes as if they had once
lived in the flesh and died like mortals, but no
one can tell whether or not they are purely
Heroes of the Myth.</p>

</div>


<h3><i>Phrixos and Helle</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">B&oelig;otia</span> is a district northwest of Athens
and quite different from the Attic plain. The
name means The Land of Cattle, because it
abounds in fat pasture-lands, is moist and fertile,
and its beautiful green meadows slope up
to the wooded mountains and lead down to
well-watered valleys. B&oelig;otia was always the
paradise of farmers, who from the conditions of
their life became famous for their stupidity.</p>

<p class="caption">THE TEMPLE TO THESEUS AT THE FOOT OF THE ACROPOLIS IN ATHENS.</p>
</div>

<p>Thebes was the capital of B&oelig;otia, but each
district had its own smaller city and its own ruling
family, whose sons called themselves kings.
One of these petty kings, Athamas, had a son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
and daughter named Phrixos and Helle, and
when their mother died he took another wife,
the fair Ino, but she was not as good as she was
fair, for she was jealous of her step-children.
So she contrived a plot for getting rid of them
which was well carried out. Ino persuaded all
the women of the country to use the seed grain
or hide it so that none of it could be used for
the next year&rsquo;s crop.</p>

<p>The women followed the queen&rsquo;s advice and
the next year there was a great famine in the
land. The women did not dare to tell their
secret, although their families were beginning
to starve. Then Athamas sent to the Oracle at
Delphi in order to find out the cause of the
trouble, and how he might deliver the country
from the distress.</p>

<p>But Ino secretly persuaded the messenger to
say that the Oracle had given the following
answer: &ldquo;The famine will cease when Athamas
has sacrificed Phrixos to Zeus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king was almost stunned with grief
when he received this message. How was it
possible for him to sacrifice his own beloved
son? But the wicked Ino published the false
Oracle among the starving people, who, driven
by hunger, clamored loudly for the death of
Phrixos. The king being compelled by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
people, allowed Phrixos to be led to the altar
to be sacrificed.</p>

<p>But the spirit of the child&rsquo;s own mother
came down in the form of a cloud to save him.
She brought a large ram whose fleece was of
shining gold, and said to the two children:
&ldquo;My dear unfortunate little ones, come and sit
on this golden sheep and he will fly away with
you and carry you safely into a far country,
where the wicked Ino will no longer have the
power of injuring you.&rdquo; Then she helped
Phrixos to mount to the back of the ram and
she placed his little sister Helle behind him
with both her arms around him, and disappeared.</p>

<p>The ram flew up into the air like a bird and
soared away over mountains and valleys and
rivers and plains. Away, away they went
through the blue sky until they reached the
straits which separate Europe from Asia.
There Helle lost her balance and fell into the
sea. In vain did Phrixos try to save his sister,
who cried and stretched out her arms to him.
The poor child was swallowed by the waves
and devoured by sea-monsters. From that
time the sea in that place has been called the
Hellespont.</p>

<p>Phrixos sailed on alone, on the back of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
ram, which took him to the farthest shore of the
Black Sea and landed him at Kolchis. There
the king received Phrixos kindly. Phrixos
sacrificed the ram to Zeus and hung up the
golden fleece in a grove which was sacred to
Ares, the God of War. The golden fleece was
priceless in value and was guarded by a terrible
sleepless dragon.</p>

<span class="smlfont">JASON CLAIMS HIS THRONE</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">More</span> than a hundred miles northwest of
Athens is Thessaly, the most northern country
of Greece. The greater part of it consists of
mountains, the highest and steepest of all
Greece. Among these the loftiest is Mount
Olympos, whose summit, with its three snowy
peaks standing out like glittering marble
against the blue sky, rises high above the surrounding
ridges. So glorious and so pure and
so high did it appear to the ancient Greeks,
that they imagined it to be the dwelling-place
of the gods. It seemed the very end of the
world as it rose up and shut off this horizon;
and they believed the throne of Zeus, himself,
to be on its summit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
When the shining crest was obscured by
clouds, pious people from many countries
around turned to it in awe and said that the
Lord of Heaven had hid his face, and waited
for him to hurl his lightnings and speak in
thunder. And the people of Thessaly loved to
walk in the Vale of Tempe, where the wild fig-tree
and wild grape, the willow, and ivy clung
with tough roots to the rugged rocks at the
foot of the mountain.</p>

<p>The most mountainous portion of Thessaly
was, of course, wild and inhospitable. The
Centaurs were said to dwell in its gorges and
caves, and it was claimed that they were wiser
and gentler than the Centaurs of Arcadia.
They were said to have gathered much lore
of herbs and forest things, and to have been
excellent surgeons. The same was told by
fame of the Thessalian mountain-women, who,
while as rugged and fierce as the men, were
said to be extremely handsome and great mistresses
in the art of making ointments and
magic waters and juices for the casting of
spells; in short, they were famous all over
Greece as the most knowing and dangerous
witches.</p>

<p>The land changed wonderfully where it
sloped down to the sea. The narrow valleys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
spread out into broad plains. The moisture,
gathered and treasured by the forests and protected
by their shade, filtered through the soil,
keeping the grass green for the large herds
which at that time were the greatest wealth,
both of farmer and king; while the thousand
rivulets and streamlets that hurried down the
mountain-side in brooks and torrents ran together
and formed handsome rivers which
scarcely ever became dry or even shallow, as
did the small and stony streams of Attica.
Many of the rivers of Attica are so small that
they never reach the sea at all, but run into the
sand and waste themselves, while the Thessalian
rivers all carry their waters to the sea.</p>

<p>The largest of them, that which flows through
the richest and most fertile country, is the Peneus,
famed in song and story. In this beautiful
land of Thessaly lived a king, Pelias. He
really had no right to the throne, for he had an
older brother. But that brother, being of a
peaceful nature, allowed Pelias to take the
crown from him, while he himself retired to
some land he had in the mountains. His son,
Jason, a handsome youth of great promise, he
sent for his education to the wise Centaur,
Chiron, who made his home in the deepest
mountain-caves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
When Jason was twenty years old and his
education in manly sports and in the art of
war, in song and in music, was such as to do
honor to his master, Chiron, he was directed
by an Oracle to go straight to his uncle Pelias
and boldly claim his father&rsquo;s kingdom. This
was an undertaking after his own heart.
Shortly after this Pelias celebrated the yearly
festival of Poseidon, the God of the Sea, by
solemn sacrifices offered on the shore. This
was a grand national occasion, so he invited
everyone around and did not dare to leave
Jason out.</p>

<p>Jason accepted the invitation. He donned
the skin of a panther which he had killed himself,
and taking two long spears, started on his
way. Now Pelias had learned from an Oracle
that he should lose his kingdom, and he was
always in fear. The Oracle had said that a
descendant of &OElig;olus would take his crown
and throne from him, and that this person
would come to him with only one sandal on.
Pelias, therefore, was always on the lookout
for the man with one sandal.</p>

<p>As Jason came along he saw an old woman
sitting on the bank of a river which he had to
cross. She begged him to take her over. The
young Greeks were taught that their first duty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
was to be helpful and respectful to old people.
Jason willingly took the old woman in his arms
and carried her over as if she had been a child.
She thanked him and wished him good luck.</p>

<p>The current of the river was strong and
rapid and it swept away one of Jason&rsquo;s sandals.
He set the old woman down on the shore after
crossing and then stood in doubt as to whether
he had better go back to look for his sandal.
The old woman, however, advised him to proceed
on his way. Then she disappeared. This
meeting turned out to be of much greater importance
to the young man than he could have
imagined, for it was the goddess Hera, the
Queen of Heaven, herself, who had taken the
shape of an old woman to test his kindness and
good-breeding. Being pleased with both, she
remained his friend and protector.</p>

<p>The public square was full of people when
Jason arrived. His face was comely, his figure
heroic, and his long hair hung down to the
panther&rsquo;s skin on his shoulders. He carried
two long spears and walked like a king. Everybody
turned in wonder to gaze at him, and
some of them said to one another, &ldquo;This stranger
is no mortal man&mdash;he must be Apollo in
disguise.&rdquo; Others said, &ldquo;No, it is the God of
War. Look at his powerful, athletic frame.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
Just at this moment Pelias came driving by
on his chariot drawn by two fleet-footed mules.
His eyes were also attracted by the beauty of
the youthful stranger, but when he noticed that
he wore only one sandal he trembled with fear.
Pelias, being old and crafty, concealed his
anxiety and received his young kinsman with
cordial friendliness seemingly. Jason at once
announced his right to the king&rsquo;s throne, and
Pelias admitted his claim.</p>

<p>But Pelias told him that he was too young
to take such a responsible place, and suggested
that so stalwart a youth ought to do some valiant
deed to win the respect and admiration of
his people before coming into power. &ldquo;The
people would not care for thee,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if
thou shouldst take the crown as a birthright
and not because of thy prowess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then King Pelias proposed, as a suitable and
honorable test of Jason&rsquo;s qualities as hero and
leader, that he should cross the Black Sea
and bring from Kolchis the golden fleece of
Phrixos&rsquo; ram. The wily old man had judged
Jason at a glance and knew that no words or
offer of his could appeal more powerfully to the
young hero&rsquo;s generous instincts; he also knew
that the danger of such an undertaking would
be attractive to his youthful imagination. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
he smiled wickedly under his beard when Jason
delightedly agreed to his proposal. Pelias
thought to himself, &ldquo;No sane man would ever
go on such an expedition, and not the bravest
man could return alive. He will never come
back, and I shall remain the King of Iolkos.&rdquo;</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="smlfont">THE EXPEDITION</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Jason</span> cared little about the motives of the
king in sending him after the Golden Fleece.
His courage ran high and the anticipation of
seeing other countries and doing valiant deeds
filled his mind. He set about building a large
ship, the finest the world had ever seen, and to
do this he employed Argos, a famous shipbuilder.
No expense or labor was spared, and
when the ship was finished it was named the
Argo in honor of the builder. It was the largest
ship that had ever sailed from Greece.</p>

<p>When the ship was ready Jason assembled
the noblest heroes of all Hellas, Herakles,
Kastor and Pollux, Meleagros, Peleus, Admetos,
Theseus, Orpheus and two sons of
Boreas, and many others of great renown.
Jason invited them to go with him on this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
expedition, and they gladly accepted the invitation.
They praised the ship; it was such a
remarkable piece of work, and said that Athena
must have advised and helped Argos, for no
human being could make such a good boat.
Jason was to be the captain, and all those who
embarked on it with him would receive the
name Argonauts, which means those who sail
in the Argo.</p>

<p>Before sailing, the heroes gathered around
the altar of Zeus, and Jason offered up a sacrifice
and prayed for a sign of good luck, if the
God looked favorably on their undertaking.
Zeus answered with a peal of thunder and a
flash of lightning, which pleased Jason and
gave the heroes courage. At first the voyage
went so smoothly that it seemed like a grand
holiday trip. As they sailed out from the
olive-clad plains surrounding Iolkos, Orpheus
with his god-like voice and magic lyre quieted
the wild waves of the sea, and inspired the men
on the Argo with love for battle.</p>

<p>In this way they sailed along until they came
to the island of Lemnos, where they were received
in kindly fashion and remained a long
time enjoying the new scenes and the festivals.
Then they set sail again and came to a small
island where they stayed a short time. Herakles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
had broken his oar and he wanted to replace
it. He left the ship, taking with him a
beautiful youth, Hylas, and they went into the
woods to cut down a tree to make a new oar.</p>

<p>But the wood-nymphs saw Hylas and said to
each other, &ldquo;We will keep this beautiful youth
to ramble with us in the forest, for he is gentle
and kind and would be an agreeable companion.
He is strong and will protect us against
the rude creatures that cause us alarm.&rdquo; So
they carried Hylas away and hid him, and
Herakles would not leave the island without
him. Then the Argo sailed on toward Kolchis,
and the heroes mourned the loss of their two
comrades.</p>

<p>They landed again soon on another island,
where lived a king who was known to fame as
a great boxer. He was cruel to travellers.
He challenged them to boxing matches and
killed them in the sport. The Argonauts asked
him to give them a supply of fresh water for
their ship, and in return he asked them to box
with him. Pollux accepted the challenge, and
gave him such a beating that his bones were
broken. Then they took all the fresh water
they needed and went back to the ship. After
this, Pollux, instead of the cruel and boastful
king, was known as the great boxer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
The Argo sailed on across the &AElig;gean Sea
and through the Hellespont, where the unfortunate
Helle was drowned, and reached the
straits of the Bosporus. There were the immense
Symplegades, two high cliffs that were
not solidly rooted in the ground, but clashed
together under the power of the winds, making
the passage through the sea dangerous. It
seemed impossible for the Argo to pass them
without being crushed.</p>

<p>But they were saved from this peril by the
advice of Phineus, the blind old king of the
district, who was also a soothsayer. Phineus
had long suffered a terrible penalty, which the
gods had sent on him for some unkindness, and
he had been punished quite enough. Whenever
he sat down to a meal the Harpies pounced
upon his food, devouring the most of it and polluting
the rest of it so that it was unspeakably
filthy. When the Argonauts asked him to direct
them past the Symplegades, he promised
to do so if they would free him from the Harpies.
This the Argonauts promised to do.</p>

<p>They set a table before him laden with food,
and the Harpies rushed down with great cries,
perching on the table, eating greedily and
snatching the food with their brazen claws.</p>

<p>Then the winged sons of Boreas, who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
with Jason, rose into the air and pursued the
Harpies with swords. The feathers of the
Harpies flew like dirt in a windstorm as they
rushed screaming this way and that. They fled
from that region, and so Phineus was rescued.</p>

<p>Phineus showed the Argonauts how to steer
their ship. He advised them to let a pigeon
fly across the Symplegades, and if the bird
passed unhurt they should quickly follow.
When the Argonauts had come near the rocks
they let a pigeon loose from the prow of their
ship. It flew through between the cliffs, and
the clashing together of the rocks caught only
the end of its tail. Watching for the moment
when the rocks should open and swing away
from each other, the Argonauts sailed between
them, rowing with all their might.</p>

<p>They called on Hera for assistance, and the
goddess bade the rocks move slowly. The
cliffs did not have time to close together upon
the ship, and she got through safely, except
that a small portion of the rudder was broken
off. From that time on the Symplegades became
one rock and remained firm. After this
the Argonauts sailed along the whole coast of
the Black Sea toward the east, and finally
reached Kolchis.</p>

<span class="smlfont">JASON FINDS THE GOLDEN FLEECE</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Argonauts had drawn their ship
up on the beach, Jason presented himself before
the king and said: &ldquo;Oh, king, we have come
to ask thee for the Golden Fleece, which belongs
to the Greeks at Iolkos. The ram which
it covered was given to Phrixos and he dedicated
it to Zeus; but the Fleece he hung up
in the garden sacred to Ares. Moreover, the
King of Iolkos has sent me to bring it back to
Hellas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king answered: &ldquo;Oh, stranger, thou art
welcome to the Fleece. Take it back to Hellas,
I pray thee. But first thou must yoke two
wild bulls, which no one has ever yet been
able to manage, to a plough, and turn up furrows
in a field and sow it with dragons&rsquo; teeth. The
bulls snort fire with every breath and have
brass hoofs. Beware lest they turn upon thee
and burn thee to death with the fire of their
nostrils, and trample thee into the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jason did not know how to tame the terrible
bulls, and began to ponder. But Medea, the
daughter of the king, saw Jason and pitied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
him. Medea was very much of a witch and
could make all sorts of charms and mixtures of
enchantment. She gave a magic ointment to
Jason and said: &ldquo;Stranger, I would gladly
help thee to tame the wild bulls. Take this
box of magic ointment and anoint thyself, also
the end of thy spear and thy shield. It will
make thee proof against fire and steel for one
day, so that they cannot harm thee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And thou shouldst know that out of the
dragons&rsquo; teeth which thou art to sow, men will
spring up all clad in armor. Hide thyself
where these men cannot see thee, and when
they stand close together throw stones among
them.&rdquo; Jason took the drug and did as he was
told. He anointed himself and his spear and
shield, and went in search of the fiery bulls.</p>

<p>As soon as he found them he went boldly up
and hitched them to a plough. They breathed
fire at him and tried to strike him with their
brazen hoofs. But he ploughed the field, turning
back furrow after furrow. Then he went
back to sow the field with dragons&rsquo; teeth and
hid himself nearby. Soon armed giants arose
out of the ground. Jason threw a large stone
into the midst of them, which made them think
that some one of their own company was attacking
the others. They began fighting among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
themselves, and became so furious with one
another that they did not see Jason approach.
He took his sword and slew them all. Then
he returned to the king to receive the Golden
Fleece.</p>

<p>But the king was surprised, for he had no intention
of keeping his promise. He expected
that Jason would be slain and never come back.
And he was contriving a plot to burn the ship
Argo, and kill Jason&rsquo;s companions.</p>

<p>Jason had done all that the king had required
of him and would not give up the idea of taking
the Fleece, and the king refused to let him have
it. Then Jason went back to Medea for advice.
Her admiration for the hero was greater than
ever, since she had seen how fearlessly he went
about his tasks.</p>

<p>She led him to the grove where hung the
Golden Fleece, and with her magic drugs put
the watchful dragon that guarded it to sleep.
Jason snatched the Fleece and made for the
ship, taking Medea, who had promised to be
his wife, with him. When the old king missed
his daughter he was very angry, and gave pursuit.
But Jason and his companions pushed
the boat out into the sea, and unfurling the
sails, they swiftly took their way over the
waters toward their own land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
After many wanderings and perils, the Argonauts
came to the Greek coast, and the Argo
entered again the sea of their own beloved
country. They reached Iolkos, bringing the
world-famous Golden Fleece with them, and
the people received them in triumph. But
Pelias still refused to give up the throne to
Jason, although he gladly took the Golden
Fleece which the young hero had brought
him. So Jason slew him and made himself
King of Iolkos; and as Medea&rsquo;s father had
once reigned in Corinth, he added that country
to his kingdom.</p>

<p>Jason lived in peace ten happy years in Kolchis,
and his kingdom prospered; but a great
trouble came upon his household. Medea,
with her black arts of witchery and enchantment
and her evil heart, could not always
please him or hold his affections. He went to
Corinth, where he met the gentle-hearted
Kreusa, and her peaceful, kindly disposition
won his heart. Now in those days a man was
not despised and looked upon as a law-breaker
if he married more than one wife, for the people
had a different standard of right and
wrong from that of the present day. And
Jason in an unlucky hour took Kreusa for his
wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
Medea was maddened with jealousy when
she heard of this, and she consulted the evil
spirits of her witchcraft to find out how she
could do away with Kreusa. She took a beautiful
dress and a crown, and having sprinkled
them with an enchanted juice, sent them to
Kreusa. Her rival accepted the gifts and put
them on, but she could never get them off
again. They clung to her and burned into her
flesh, so that she died. Then Medea took further
revenge by burning Kreusa&rsquo;s home; and
when she found that Jason was angry with her
she slew her children and fled from Iolkos in a
fiery chariot drawn by winged serpents. Poor
Jason, beside himself with grief, went to his
good ship Argo, which was now kept as a
sacred place for the worship of the gods, and
there he died.</p>

<span class="smlfont">ORPHEUS, THE HERO OF THE LYRE</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the same land of Thrace in which Jason&rsquo;s
family ruled, Orpheus, the greatest musician
of Greece, was born. It was said that his
mother was the Goddess of Song, and such was
the power of his voice and his art of playing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
on the lyre that he could move stones and
trees. When the wild beasts heard his music
they left their dens and lay down at his feet,
the birds in the trees stopped singing, and the
fishes came to the surface of the sea to listen
to him.</p>

<p>Orpheus had a wife, Eurydike, celebrated
for her beauty and virtue, and he loved her very
dearly. One day when Eurydike was gathering
flowers on the bank of a lake a venomous
snake bit her foot and she died. Orpheus
could not be consoled. He went off into the
wildest waste that he could find and there he
mourned day and night till all nature shared
in his grief. At last he made up his mind to
go down into Hades and beg her back of King
Pluto, for life was worthless without her.</p>

<p>Orpheus took his lyre, and singing as he went,
found his way down to Hades through a dismal
abyss. Grim Cerberus himself held his
breath to listen to the marvellous music. Not
one bark did he give from any of his three terrible
heads, and when Orpheus passed him
he crouched at his feet. So Orpheus entered
Hades unhindered, and standing before the
throne of Pluto and his pale queen Persephone,
he said: &ldquo;Oh, king and queen, I have not come
down into Hades to see the gloomy Tartaros,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
nor in order to carry away the three-headed
warder of your kingdom, the dreadful Cerberus.
I came down to implore you to give
me back my beloved wife, Eurydike. I cannot
bear life without her. To me the world is
a desert, and life a burden. Why should she
die, so young and beautiful? Have pity on
me! If I may not take her back, then I will
not again see the light of the sun, but I, too,
will remain in the gloomy Hades.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pluto and Persephone listened in silence to
the pleadings of Orpheus. His pathetic voice
and the sweet tones of his melodious lyre held
them like a charm. The shades of the dead
came flocking around him and mourned. Tantalos
forgot his thirst and listened to the singer&rsquo;s
complaints. Sisyphos, who was compelled
to roll a stone to the top of a mountain whence
it always dashed back again to the bottom,
ceased his dreadful labor to listen, and the
Furies themselves first shed tears.</p>

<p class="caption">ORPHEUS LEADING EURYDIKE OUT OF HADES.<br />
(From the painting by Corot.)</p>
</div>

<p>Persephone and Pluto were pitiless gods.
Their hearts were long since hardened to the
cries of the living who prayed for the restoration
of their loved ones. But they could not
resist the power of the enchanting sounds that
Orpheus made. They called the spirit of the
beautiful Eurydike to them and said to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
musician: &ldquo;Take thy wife Eurydike and go
up again to the light of the sun. Let her gaze
on the smiling sky and see the fields of the
upper world. But beware of one thing. Let
her follow thee and do not turn around to look
at her before reaching the world of the living.
If thou shouldst turn and look upon her she
will return at once to her place among the
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Orpheus left Hades in great haste and Eurydike
followed him. In the midst of deepest
silence they ascended through dismal rocky
places. They neared their journey&rsquo;s end.
They could almost see the green earth when
Orpheus was seized with a dreadful doubt.
&ldquo;I hear no sound whatever behind me,&rdquo; he
said to himself. &ldquo;Is my beloved Eurydike
really following me?&rdquo; He turned his head a
little. He saw Eurydike, who followed him
like a shadow. But suddenly she began to be
drawn backward. She stretched out her arms
toward Orpheus as if imploring his help.
Orpheus hurried to take her in his arms,
but she vanished from his sight and Orpheus
was alone again.</p>

<p>Yet he did not despair. Again he descended
into Hades and reached the river which
separates this world from that of the dead, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
the boatman, Charon, refused to ferry him
across. Seven days and seven nights Orpheus
remained there without drink or food, weeping
and mourning. The decree of the gods was
not to be changed. When Orpheus found that
he could effect nothing he returned to the
earth. He wandered alone over the mountains
and glens of Thrace, which resounded
with his plaintive songs day and night.</p>

<p>One day as he sat upon a grassy spot and
played his lyre a troop of wild women who
were celebrating a festival rushed upon him
and tried to make him play for them to dance.
Orpheus indignantly refused, and they grew
angry and handled him so roughly that he
died. Where he was buried the nightingales
sang more sweetly than elsewhere. And his
lyre, which was thrown into the sea, was
caught by the waves, which made sweet music
upon it as they rose and fell.</p>

<p>Orpheus was honored by the gods, and after
his death they brought him to the Abode of
the Blessed, where he found his beloved Eurydike
and was reunited to her.</p>

<h2><a name="chap24" id="chap24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<span class="smlfont">PELOPS, THE HERO OF THE PELOPONNESOS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> of the heroes famed in Greek song and
story, and whose descendants lived in Greece,
had come from foreign countries, many of them
from Asia Minor. Greece and Asia Minor had
always been closely connected. Travellers
from each were in the habit of visiting the
other country. Sometimes they traded together
and sometimes made war on each other.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful kingdoms of Asia
Minor was Phrygia, and it was ruled by a king
of the name of Tantalos, who had at first governed
wisely and in the fear of the gods. He
was made arrogant by prosperity, and at length
grew so overbearing and cruel even to his own
son, Pelops, that the gods determined to make
an example of him. They sent him living to
Tartaros, the portion of Hades reserved for the
very worst offenders, there to endure a terrible
punishment forever.</p>

<p>He was placed up to his waist in the midst
of running water, clear and cool, under hanging
boughs laden with lovely fruit. Yet he
could not reach the water or the fruit, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
always faint with hunger and thirst. Whenever
he bent down to get a drink of water it
rapidly rushed away from him, and if he lifted
up his hand to pluck some of the ripe fragrant
fruit, a sudden gust of wind tossed the branches
high up into the air. Poor Tantalos never
came nearer than this to quenching his thirst
or satisfying his hunger.</p>

<p>To make his misery more unbearable, a huge
block of rock was poised above his head, so
lightly that it moved with every breeze, and he
was in perpetual fear of its falling down on him.
Pelops, the son whom he had abused in childhood,
became a great favorite with the gods,
and they wished to make up to him for his
father&rsquo;s cruelty. They gave him a shoulder of
ivory to replace the shoulder of which his father
had deprived him. When he grew up the gods
helped him to leave his native land, where he
had been ill-treated, and they guided him across
the &AElig;gean Sea, and around the southern point
of Greece to Elis, where Herakles had cleaned
out the stables of Augeias. The capital of Elis
was the city of Pisa, where a king ruled who
had a beautiful daughter named Hippodameia.
She must have been very fond of sports and
athletics, for her name means &ldquo;The Tamer of
Horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
Hippodameia had many suitors, but her
father, &OElig;nomaos, had heard that he would be
dethroned by his daughter&rsquo;s husband, and so
he did not wish her to marry. He was very
warlike, being a son of Ares, the God of War,
and he determined to kill all the suitors. So
he proposed a chariot race with each of the
wooers, and promised that the one who succeeded
in winning the race should have his
daughter in marriage; on the other hand, if the
suitor lost the race he should be put to death
by the king.</p>

<p>&OElig;nomaos was a famous charioteer, and he
had steeds which were swifter than the wind.
The race-course began at Pisa, and stretched as
far as the Isthmus of Corinth to the altar of
Poseidon. &OElig;nomaos believed in himself and
in his own skill. So great was his self-reliance,
and so sure was he of the swiftness of his horses,
that whenever a suitor came along he let him
go ahead with his chariot drawn by four horses,
while he himself first sacrificed a ram to Zeus,
and only at the end of the ceremony mounted
his chariot, having as driver, Myrtilos, and being
armed with a strong spear. Then he would
overtake the suitor and kill him. Thus he had
already killed a great many.</p>

<p>Pelops, on his arrival at Pisa, saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
Hippodameia, and at once had a strong desire to make
her his wife. When he saw that he could not
conquer &OElig;nomaos by fair means he planned a
trick. He secretly approached the king&rsquo;s charioteer,
Myrtilos, and said to him: &ldquo;Myrtilos,
hear what I have to say to thee. Help me to
win the race and I will give thee half the kingdom
when I become King of Pisa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hippodameia, too, who greatly admired the
young man, advised the charioteer to lend them
his aid. Myrtilos accepted the proposal of
Pelops. On the day of the race &OElig;nomaos
again waited to sacrifice a ram to Zeus, leaving
Pelops to drive on ahead, and only mounted
his chariot after the offering was over, being
sure that he should overtake the suitor as he
had done with the others.</p>

<p>But suddenly a wheel flew off from the king&rsquo;s
chariot, and &OElig;nomaos fell to the ground, hurting
himself badly. Myrtilos had removed the
pin which held the wheel on to the axle. Thus
Pelops reached the Isthmus before the king
and won the race.</p>

<p>&OElig;nomaos died of his injuries, and Pelops
married Hippodameia, and took possession of
the kingdom. Then Myrtilos demanded half
the kingdom as it had been promised him by
Pelops. But Pelops carried him to the sea and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
cast him into it. On account of this crime the
descendants of Pelops, the Pelopides, had to
suffer many misfortunes. Crime and craft may
answer an immediate purpose, but they are followed
by divine wrath.</p>

<p>Pelops instituted the famous Olympic games,
which were celebrated every fourth year, and
lasted five days. And he did many other things
which were of great use to his people. In
honor of Pelops, the great peninsula, south of
the Isthmus of Corinth, was called Peloponnesos,
which means Pelops&rsquo; Island. The name
was not quite correct at the time, for the land
was not an island but a peninsula. But after
all these thousands of years it has curiously
come to pass that the old name is a true one,
for it was only a few years ago that the Isthmus
of Corinth was cut in two, and the Peloponnesos
was in truth made an island.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="chap25" id="chap25"></a>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<span class="smlfont">PERSEUS, THE HERO OF ARGOS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Less</span> than sixty miles in a straight line to the
southwest of Athens there is a barren, swampy
plain. It is in the Peloponnesos and is bounded
on all sides by mountains except to the south,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
where it is bounded by the sea. In this plain
lies the market-town, Argos, at the foot of a lofty
hill, its acropolis, Larisa. There is a citadel on
this acropolis which looks off to a high mountain
at the north near the Isthmus of Corinth,
and the white-streaked hills beyond. And
nearer to the citadel, on the north, is a higher
mountain, the highest of the Peloponnesos,
where the people used to pray to Zeus and Hera
for rain. To the southeast the Larisa looks
over a great prison on a fortified mountain.</p>

<p>We have said that the Peloponnesos was the
shape of a man&rsquo;s hand. The thumb of this hand
is a peninsula pointing toward the east and
south. In more ancient times this thumb was
called the peninsula of Argos. The town, Argos,
shares its name with the barren plain in which
it is situated, and in olden times it shared it with
the peninsula also. The peninsula of Argos
was quite separate from a larger district, called
Argolis, until the Romans conquered Greece.
But now it is one with the entire district, and
Argos the town, and Argos the plain, and
Argos the peninsula, are all in Argolis.</p>

<p>Hera, wife of Zeus and goddess of the
heavens, was the patron deity of Argos. It is
said that she had a contest with Poseidon to see
which should name the land, and as she brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
the most valuable gift, the honor fell to her. The
river Inachos flows through Argos the plain.
The first king of Argos was a son of the river-god,
Inachos, and the ocean-nymph, Melia, was
his mother.</p>

<p>The earliest people of Argos must have
worked hard to keep the country rightly irrigated.
They were called Dana&aelig;, doubtless
because their work resembled that of the
Dana&iuml;ds, who were said to be punished in the
lower world by carrying water in pitchers to
fill a broken cistern. As fast as they poured
water in the cistern it ran out through the
cracks at the bottom. So, too, the Dana&aelig; carried
water to the sandy soil, but it ran into the
earth without doing very much good.</p>

<p>The Dana&aelig; came from Egypt and were accustomed
to farming in the sand. They knew
the unsparing pains that must be taken to conquer
it, and kept at work until the land became
fertile enough to repay them. But in modern
times the plain has lost its fertility because the
farmers do not take the same trouble in cultivating
the soil.</p>

<p>One of the earliest of the Argive kings,
Danaos, sent his daughters out to search for
springs as he would have sent them to bring
water from the Nile if they had remained in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
Egypt. Poseidon, seeing how fair one of them
was, loved her and caused a spring to flow at
Lerna, and it is called by her own name, Amyone,
to the present time. It was this spring that
created the marsh where the terrible Hydra
was slain by Herakles.</p>

<p>Danaos had many descendants, one after
another succeeding him as king. The fifth successor
was Akrisios and he had a daughter,
Dan&auml;e. Some oracle had told him that he
would be slain by a son of Dan&auml;e if she ever
had one. This worried the king and he determined
that she should never marry. He built
a high tower of brass and shut her up in it so
that no one could get to her.</p>

<p>Dan&auml;e grew very lonely, shut up in the tower,
and she used to watch from the window to try
to catch a glimpse of the people below. No one
looked up to notice her, but Zeus saw her from
his abode in the heavens and was struck with
her beauty and loneliness. He sent a golden
shower of sunbeams to console her in her prison,
and a little babe was born to her, and she called
him Perseus, the son of Light.</p>

<p>Akrisios, the king, heard the child&rsquo;s voice
and called his daughter to a holy sanctuary and
bade her tell the truth about the babe. This
she did, but the king would not believe her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
He put her into a box and the child with her
and cast the box into the sea to sink or float.
The box did float and the kind waves carried it
to the island of Seriphos. A good old fisherman
caught it in a net and took it to his own
little hut, and thus Dan&auml;e and her babe were
saved.</p>

<p>Perseus grew up to be a strong, handsome lad,
and was often seen with his beautiful mother
wandering over the island. As Perseus grew
older he became his mother&rsquo;s protector and
champion and could never do enough for her.
They continued to live at the cottage of the
fisherman, who had adopted them as members
of his own family.</p>

<p>The fisherman had a brother, Polydektes,
who was king of the island, and he was as
proud and cruel as the fisherman was simple
and kind. Polydektes saw the beautiful Dan&auml;e
and resolved to add her to his possessions and
make her subject to his whims. He feared
Perseus, however, and studied how to get him
out of the way. So he called his friends together,
among them Perseus, and said that he
was looking for quaint gifts to send to the wedding
of Hippodameia, the daughter of &OElig;nomaos.</p>

<p>All the young men came to the court of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
king and listened to his request, and each one
promised to go on some quest and find a present
worthy of the princess. Perseus wanted
to outdo all the others, and said he would
bring the head of Medusa if the king desired
it. Polydektes took him at his word and
ordered him to go for it at once.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="chap26" id="chap26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<span class="smlfont">PERSEUS FINDS THE GORGONS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Medusa</span> was the youngest of three sisters
known as the Gorgons, who lived somewhere
in the far west by the ocean. She was the fairest
of the three and in her youth had been a
famous beauty. But having insulted Athena
in her holy temple, that goddess punished her
by spoiling her beauty in a most ghastly way.
She changed her beautiful locks into living
snakes. A great horror settled on the face of
the poor girl, and it became so terrible in its
look of agony, with its frightful frame of
snakes, that no one could bear the sight. Whoever
looked at her turned to stone.</p>

<p>Perseus set forth to find Medusa with the
courage of a youth who has never known defeat.
The goddess, Athena, who particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
despised the Gorgon, lent him her aid. She
advised him to go to three aged women, who
lived in a dark cavern near the entrance to the
infernal regions. They were old women from
their birth, gray-haired, misshapen, and had
but one eye and a single tooth for the three.
These they exchanged, each taking a turn at
using the tooth and eye, while the other two
sat toothless and blind.</p>

<p>Perseus approached them quietly, for they
were easily alarmed and always on the lookout
for something to dread. As they were passing
the eye from one to the other, Perseus seized
it, and they pleaded piteously for him to restore
it. This Perseus refused to do until they
should tell him the way to the home of the
nymphs who took care of the invisible helmet
of Hades and the winged shoes of Hermes,
messenger of the gods. The three miserable
old women were glad to get back their eye and
tooth, although they were loath to give Perseus
the information he wanted. But they told him
the way to find the home of the nymphs, and
he went on with a happier heart.</p>

<p>Perseus received the winged sandals from
the nymphs and bound them to his own feet.
They gave him a mantle, too, which he threw
over his shoulders. It made him invisible, just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
as the darkness of night hides everything from
human eyes. They put the helmet of Hades
on his head. Whoever wore this helmet could
see others, but no one could see him. Moreover,
Hermes gave him a two-edged sword
and Athena gave him a shield of brass, which
was polished on the inside until it glittered like
a mirror and reflected the image of everything
back of the person using it.</p>

<p>Perseus, being thus armed, went flying toward
the ocean and found the Gorgons lying on
the shore. There were three of them and they
were sisters. Medusa alone was immortal. The
other Gorgons, as well as Medusa, had snakes
on their heads instead of hair, and large teeth
like wild beasts, and iron hands with golden
nails. Athena had taught Perseus how to approach
them without being the victim of Medusa&rsquo;s
deadly stare. Instead of facing her, he
kept his face turned toward his shield and
looked at her image only.</p>

<p>In this way, guarded by his cloak and helmet
of invisibility, he came close to Medusa, and
with one blow from his two-edged sword cut
off the monster&rsquo;s head. As the blood flowed
down over the sand, there sprang from it a
beautiful white-winged horse. Perseus had
brought a large pouch which the nymphs had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
given him; a magic pocket that could be distended
to almost any size. He hurried the
head into the pouch without looking at it and
flew away as fast as his winged sandals would
carry him; the other Gorgons followed him in
vain, for he was invisible to them.</p>

<span class="smlfont">PERSEUS RESCUES ANDROMEDA</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> his way back to the island of Seriphos,
Perseus met with many adventures. He visited
Atlas, expecting the hospitality which the
Greeks consider due to all strangers. But
Atlas did not receive him with courtesy, and
Perseus in return held up the Gorgon&rsquo;s head
for Atlas to gaze at. Atlas was turned into a
rocky mountain, and there he stands and always
will stand with the firmament resting on his
head.</p>

<p>In his flight Perseus reached &AElig;theopia, where
King Kepheus reigned. There he saw an immense
rock on the coast and a charming maiden
was chained to the rock. Perseus approached
her in pity and said, &ldquo;Tell me, oh maiden, why
thou art bound to this rock! What is thy name
and which is thy country?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am a princess,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
the daughter of King Kepheus,&rdquo; answered the
girl, &ldquo;and my name is Andromeda. My mother
praised my beauty above that of the daughters
of Nereus, displeasing the nymphs themselves
and offending the god.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Nereids complained to Poseidon, and
in his wrath he sent a sea-monster on shore to
destroy the people and their flocks and herds
and devastate the country. The king, my
father, inquired of the Oracle how the country
might be freed from this calamity. The Oracle
made reply that the country would be delivered
if the king would give up his own
daughter to be devoured by the monster.
When the people of &AElig;theopia heard of the
answer of the Oracle they forced my father to
accede to the terms. They themselves chained
me to this rock, and every moment I expect the
monster to come and tear me to pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner had Andromeda finished her tale
than the monster appeared in the distance.
Her father and mother saw him too and wept
in despair. Crying out to their beloved child,
with extended hands they bewailed her fate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A truce to tears!&rdquo; cried Perseus. &ldquo;The
brave man sheds no tears in the face of danger!
He wastes no words but dares! Shall Perseus,
the son of Zeus and Dan&auml;e, having slain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
Medusa, quail before a sea-serpent? I will save
thy daughter, but thou must give her to me to
be my wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt have our daughter for thy wife
and our kingdom as well,&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;if
thou wilt save her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waves rose higher and higher around
the cliff and the sea-monster came roaring and
hissing, with open jaws showing his savage
teeth, his neck outstretched, and his head reared
high above the breakers. Over the waves rose
his tremendous back covered with thick, heavy
scales, and he lashed the waters to a foam with
his coiling tail.</p>

<p>Then Perseus, with the aid of his winged
sandals, rose up into the air and attacked the
monster from above. The beast plunged this
way and that, leaping up and striking at Perseus
with his fangs, diving again into the water
and springing out, bellowing in a frightful
manner.</p>

<p>Time after time Perseus thrust his sword
into the monster, until a stream of black blood
ran from its throat, and it grew motionless and
died. Perseus quickly flew to Andromeda and
took off the chains that bound her, and she
sprang into her father&rsquo;s arms with a cry of joy.
The king and queen threw their arms around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
their beloved daughter and covered her with
kisses, and they clasped the hand of Perseus
with gratitude which they could not express.</p>

<p>Then they returned to the grand castle of
Kepheus, promising to celebrate the nuptials of
Perseus and Andromeda. The wedding took
place amidst great pomp and splendor, but
while they were in the midst of their festivities
the din of arms and battle-cries resounded
through the hall. Phineus, the brother of the
king, had come with a crowd of warriors to
steal the bride. For Andromeda, before her
misfortunes, had been promised to him in marriage,
but in the hour of danger he had left her
to her fate, a prey to the sea-monster.</p>

<p>Now that she was safe again and in favor,
Phineus had come to claim her. He said petulantly
to Perseus, &ldquo;Andromeda belongs to me.
I come to get her. Neither thy winged sandals
nor thy father Zeus shall save thee from my
wrath. Thou art a robber trying to take my
bride from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the king answered him angrily. &ldquo;Phineus,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;thou art a boastful coward.
In no way does Perseus rob thee of Andromeda.
Thou hast lost her through thine own
fault, for when she was in peril thou didst
desert her like a coward, and she would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
been devoured by the sea-monster before now
if this noble youth had not saved her. My
daughter shall wed the man who has saved her
from a terrible death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Phineus would not yield. Wishing to
kill Perseus, he shot an arrow at him. At the
same time he ordered his band of followers to
rush upon him. The arrow did not hit Perseus,
who fought single-handed against them all, but
as soon as he struck down one foe a new one
sprang up in his place. Perseus saw that he
could keep on fighting for all time, and never
conquer this army, which could furnish a new
warrior as often as one was slain. Having
thus fought alone against great numbers until
he saw it was hopeless, Perseus took the head
of Medusa out of the pouch where he had kept
it and held it up for Phineus and his warriors
to gaze upon. Instantly everyone of them
was changed to stone, and Perseus, taking his
bride, returned to the island of Seriphos.</p>

<span class="smlfont">PERSEUS BECOMES KING OF TIRYNS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Perseus reached home he did not find
the glad welcome to which he had looked forward
with all the ardor of a youth who has
been for the first time on an important errand.
His mother had taken refuge in a temple at
the altar of Zeus to escape the persecutions of
King Polydektes, who had begun to ill-treat her
as soon as Perseus had departed in search of
Medusa. His brother, the fisherman, had tried
to protect her and had used hot words in
warning the king to desist from his unmanly
purpose. But Polydektes turned his wrath
upon his brother also, and he, too, could find no
refuge save the sacred altars.</p>

<p>Perseus went at once to the king and announced
his arrival. The king was uneasy,
and yet he did not believe that Perseus had
been able to keep his word. He called all the
nobles of his court together to listen to what
Perseus had to say. Perseus came before
them, and taking the fearful head from its covering,
held it up for them to look at. At once
they became stone images, a ghastly court of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
petrified men. Even the frogs and beetles and
other animals in the castle and its grounds
were turned to stone.</p>

<p>Then Perseus flew to his mother, who was
still a beautiful woman in spite of all her sorrows.
She had long prayed for her son&rsquo;s return,
almost without hope, and now that he
had really come her joy was boundless. Perseus
established the fisherman as king of the
island in his brother&rsquo;s place, and the people
rejoiced that they had been freed from the
tyrant, Polydektes.</p>

<p>Perseus now gave up his winged sandals to
Hermes, and asked him to carry the helmet
and mantle to the nymphs, but the head of
Medusa he gave to Athena, who wore it on
her shield ever after.</p>

<p>Perseus could not remain idle at Seriphos.
He set out for Argos to visit his grandfather,
taking his mother and Andromeda. Akrisios,
suspecting that he would come, for the words
of the Oracle often came to his mind, had gone
to Thessaly. There at Larissa he had built a
home and established himself, hoping that his
grandson would be contented to remain in
Argos.</p>

<p>But Perseus went on until he came to Thessaly,
and finding some games going on he took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
part in them. He threw a discus which accidentally
struck his grandfather&rsquo;s foot, giving
him a painful wound which could not be cured.
Thus the Oracle was fulfilled. Learning whom
he had killed and that Akrisios had died according
to an old prophecy, he mourned for him
and buried him with honors outside of the city.</p>

<p>Perseus then returned to Argos, where he had
left his wife and mother, and he became king
of the country in the place of his grandfather,
Akrisios. But the thought of sitting on a
throne whose rightful king he had accidentally
killed was distasteful to him, so he exchanged
kingdoms with Megapenthes of Tiryns.</p>

<p>It is said that the Persian kings claimed to
be descendants from Perses, a son of Perseus
and Andromeda. However this may be, Perseus
has certainly inspired many a poet and
artist and hero to express great actions and
courage in word and deed.</p>

<span class="smlfont">TRIPTOLEMOS, THE HERO OF ELEUSIS, AND
DEMETER, THE EARTH-MOTHER</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Twelve</span> miles to the west of Athens is a
beautiful hill which ends abruptly close to the
sea. It is the acropolis or highest point of
Eleusis and is covered with splendid blocks of
marble, the ruins of wonderful temples which
stood there in ancient times. The greatest of
these temples was called The Temple of the
Mysteries. Demeter, the Earth-Mother, was
worshipped there.</p>

<p>The principal road leading to the acropolis
of Eleusis begins at the acropolis at Athens
and is called The Sacred Way. Over this
road, thousands of years ago, went the stately
processions of loose-robed Greeks, their beautiful
garments fluttering in the winds. Their
heavy chariot-wheels left deep prints in the
rocks, and there they are at the present time.
There are ruins of temples to the gods along
The Sacred Way, and the little lambs and kids
skip playfully about among them.</p>

<p>A narrow pass between the hills admits you
into a flowery meadow. It was here that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
Persephone played when a child. There are two
salt lakes in the plain in which only priests
were allowed to fish in the olden times. There,
too, is a well where you stop for a cup of water
as people have done through the long ages.</p>

<p>The plain of Eleusis is separated from Attica
by a range of low hills clad with fields of wheat
and barley. At the foot of the acropolis is the
sickly little village of Eleusis, but the Island
of Salamis rises across the blue waters of the
bay like a fairyland shining through a delicate
atmosphere of violet tint. This was the kingdom
of Keleos and his son Triptolemos, the
Hero of Agriculture, and it was the scene of
the story of Demeter and Persephone, the
story which brings us to the Hero of Eleusis.</p>

<p>It is said that Kronos and Rhea were the
father and mother of the greatest of the gods,
Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades or (Pluto) and their
sister Demeter, the mother of fertility. Though
men might plough the fields and the rain moisten
the swelling seed-grains, it was Demeter
who gave the vital touch which caused the
new life to spring up.</p>

<p>Demeter had one beloved daughter, Persephone,
on whom she bestowed all the tenderness
of her divine mother-heart. One day
Persephone went out into the blooming meadows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
to play with her companions. The fields
were gay with roses, violets, and lilies. The
yellow crocus, the asphodel, and the purple and
pink narcissus made bank and by-path seem
like a soft carpet and filled the air with sweet
fragrance.</p>

<p>Persephone stooped to pluck a flower of unusual
beauty, when the earth suddenly opened
and Hades appeared with a splendid chariot
drawn by fiery black horses. He seized Persephone,
and placing her on his chariot, drove
away to his kingdom under the earth. Persephone
uttered piercing cries, praying to the
gods and imploring men to come to her rescue.
But all in vain. Zeus looked on with approval,
for he knew that his good brother ought not
to be condemned to reign alone in the dread
realms of darkness.</p>

<p>Now there was a goddess of the night, a
torch-bearer who lived in a dark cave. Her
name was Hekate and she knew the secrets of
lonely forests and cross-roads and the gloomy
underground world. She heard the shrieks of
the maiden when Hades seized her; and Helios,
too, the sun-god who sees everything, saw
him bear her away.</p>

<p>The mother, Demeter, also, heard the cries
of her daughter, and an unspeakable grief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
took possession of her. She wandered from
place to place, taking neither food nor sleep,
beseeching everyone to tell her where she
could find her child. But no one could give
her any information. She yoked her winged
snakes to her car and drove with lighted torch
through every country. Wherever she went
she was received gladly by the people, for she
stopped to teach them something of agriculture
and left her blessing with them when she
departed.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="chap30" id="chap30"></a>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<span class="smlfont">DEMETER&rsquo;S GRIEF</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the tenth day of her wanderings she met
Hekate, who said: &ldquo;Lovable Demeter, who
hath robbed thee of thy daughter and plunged
thee into sorrow? I heard her cries when she
was carried off, but I could not see who it was
that took her. There is one, however, who
sees everything, Helios, and he may tell thee
where thy daughter is concealed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Demeter gladly took the hint, and with Hekate
she set out to find Helios, and when they
saw his horses and chariot they stationed themselves
where they could speak to him. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
venerable goddess said to him: &ldquo;If ever, oh,
Helios, I have pleased thee in word or deed, I
pray thee look down from the heavens and tell
me truly whether it is a god or a mortal that
hath stolen my daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honored Queen,&rdquo; replied Helios, &ldquo;I willingly
tell thee all I know. Hades hath taken
thy daughter and led her into the gloomy
kingdom below. But Zeus is the author of
this deed, for he gave his permission to Hades
to make Persephone his wife. Yet thou hast
no need to grieve, for Hades is a loving husband
and hath given thy daughter an honorable
place as queen of his realm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Demeter heard this her grief was
unbounded and her anger terrible. She left
the abode of the gods on Mount Olympos and
went down to earth, where she assumed the
form of a mortal woman. In her travels on the
earth she reached Eleusis, and sat down on a
stone near a spring, from which the people
drew water.</p>

<p>As she sat there two beautiful maidens,
daughters of Keleos, the King of Eleusis, came
to the spring to fill their bronze pitchers with
water. They saw the stately woman in garments
of mourning, and, approaching her, asked
with sympathy whence she came and why she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
sat alone so far from the city instead of coming
to the houses, where the women would gladly
show her every kindness in word and deed.</p>

<p>Demeter replied: &ldquo;May the Olympian gods
bestow all good gifts upon you, my daughters.
Have pity on me and lead me to the house of
some chief, where I may be a servant, doing
such work as an old woman can perform. I can
take care of a new-born babe, guard the house,
tend the beds, and teach serving-women housework.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Venerable lady,&rdquo; answered one of the
daughters, &ldquo;I thank thee for thy good wishes,
and I will tell thee the names of the foremost
men of the city. There are several chiefs of
note in Eleusis, but our father is the king and
he will give thee royal welcome. Let us take
thee to our mother, Metaneira, and she will
not let thee go into a strange house. She has
a little son, and if thou wilt bring him up well
she will give thee rich gifts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Demeter consented to go, and the girls, after
filling their jugs, hastened home, where they
told the queen, their mother, what they had
seen and heard. The beautiful Metaneira sent
them to call in the aged woman, and they ran
back to the spot where they had left her.
They took her by the hand and led her to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
their home, where they presented her to their
mother.</p>

<p>Metaneira had her baby in her arms and
received Demeter kindly. &ldquo;Welcome, my
dear woman,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thou hast come in
good time. But I cannot treat thee as a servant,
for thou dost appear like a princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gods often visit us with misfortunes,
which we must bear as best we can. Let this
home be thine and I will trust this babe of mine
to thee, that thou mayst rear him. We had no
hope of his living when he was born, but the
gods had pity on me and let him live. For
this reason he is much dearer to me. Care for
him most lovingly and I will give thee a fitting
reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My greeting I give to thee, too, dear lady,&rdquo;
answered Demeter. &ldquo;May the gods give thee
all thy desires. I will tend thy child with affection
as if he were my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Demeter made herself at home in the large
hall of Keleos and undertook the bringing up
of the boy. She gave him no other food but
ambrosia, that he might never grow feeble
with old age. The child throve wonderfully
and was a joy to everybody. The father and
mother were astonished at his rapid growth
and handsome face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
But one night Metaneira wished to see how
her son was getting along, and, going into the
room where Demeter was tending him, saw a
strange sight, for the supposed old woman held
him over a fire like a brand. Metaneira, terribly
frightened, cried out, &ldquo;Oh, my child, the
stranger is burning thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the goddess grew angry, took the child
out of the fire, and setting it down on the
ground, made reply: &ldquo;Surely mortals are blind
and incapable of telling good from evil. I vow
to thee by the waters of the Styx that I have
rendered thy beloved son immortal. I put him
on the fire that it should render his mortal flesh
impervious to the ills of men. For thee it is an
eternal honor that I have lived in thy house
and let thee sit in my presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that instant Demeter threw off her disguise
as an old woman and appeared in all her
glory as a goddess. Her face shone like the
sun, and a heavenly odor was shed from her
robe, and her golden hair glittered as it fell
over her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know that I am the goddess Demeter,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;who am honored by mortals and immortals.
Thou shalt hasten to bid the whole
populace of Eleusis to build me a great temple
above the spring on the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
Metaneira was speechless with astonishment
at what she had heard and seen. She began to
tremble and did not even take heed of her
child, who sat on the floor looking at them with
wonder. She went at once to her husband and
told him all that had happened. King Keleos
called his people together in a general assembly
and ordered a beautiful temple to be built on
the acropolis in honor of Demeter.</p>

<p>The people loved their king and believed his
words, and they went to work at once to build
the temple. They set about it with such zeal
that it was finished in one day, for the goddess
gave them divine strength and directed the
work. Demeter took up her abode in the
temple and remained away from the other gods,
still mourning over the loss of her daughter.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="chap31" id="chap31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI<br />

<span class="smlfont">DEMETER&rsquo;S JOY</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Persephone</span> did not return, and the angry
goddess grew more angry. She determined to
punish the gods, even though it brought suffering
to mankind. Indeed there was no other
way to punish them. So she forbade the earth
to bring forth any more fruit, and there was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
great famine. In vain did the oxen pull the
plough through the field. In vain did the
farmer sow the grain. The land was covered
with stubble. No flower sprang up on the
parched earth; the starving people had no sacrifice
to offer to the gods, and their altars were
left without the incense arising from sacred
offerings.</p>

<p>Now the gods loved the praises of men, and
the incense from their altars was most precious
to them. They complained to Zeus because
they were deprived of their incense, and Zeus
saw the cause of it. He sent the rainbow-winged
Iris to call Demeter back to Mount
Olympos.</p>

<p>The beautiful messenger flew like a sunbeam
through the space between heaven and earth,
and soon reached Eleusis. She found Demeter
in her temple and said to her, &ldquo;Dear Mother, I
bring a message to thee from the great god
Zeus. He commands thee to return to the
abode of the immortal gods, and his command
no one dares to disobey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Demeter received the command with
scorn, so Zeus sent all the gods, one after another,
to entreat her to return, and he sent
promises of beautiful gifts and courtly honors,
but Demeter remained unmoved. &ldquo;The earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
shall yield no fruits,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;nor will I return
to the company of the gods until I behold
with mine own eyes my beautiful daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Zeus sent Hermes to Hades to persuade
him with sweet words to give up his wife
and send her back to her mother since Demeter&rsquo;s
anger could not be appeased without her.
Hermes went down to the under-world to the
King of the Dead, and said to him: &ldquo;Immortal
Hades, father Zeus has charged me to take thy
wife from this dark realm back to the light of
day that her mother may see her, for the anger
of the goddess cannot be appeased. In her
wrath she is starving men and depriving the
gods of the honors that mortals bestow on
them. She hath left the home of the gods and
will not abide with them. Neither will she
speak to them, but lives alone in her temple at
Eleusis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grim king smiled and said to his wife,
&ldquo;Persephone, my queen, go to thy blue-robed
mother and appease her wrath. The winter is
over and thou must see the light of the sun.
But first thou shalt eat with me of the pomegranate,
the apple of love, for thou dost love
me and this shall keep thee in remembrance of
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Persephone took from the king the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
pomegranate and ate it, for the grim Hades had
made her truly a queen and had done honors to
her. But she was glad to return to her mother
and the blessed light of the day. She mounted
the chariot. Hermes took the reins and the
whip, and the horses flew over the stony road
that led from Hades. On and on they went
until they reached the Eleusinian plains and the
temple of Demeter.</p>

<p>There they emerged from the cave close to
the temple, and a fig-tree burst into budding as
they came. Demeter stood with outstretched
arms at the mouth of the cave to receive her
daughter. Hermes helped her from the chariot
and Persephone sprang into her mother&rsquo;s arms
as the flowers of May spring forth on the bosom
of earth with the early showers.</p>

<p>No one can describe Demeter&rsquo;s joy as she
beheld once more her beloved child, and pressed
her to her heart, covering her with kisses. The
whole earth smiled and burst into verdant
growth. The fields were covered with grain.
The meadows bloomed with gay flowers. The
birds sang and the people rejoiced.</p>

(Lord Leighton.)</p>
</div>

<p>Demeter drew her daughter into the holiest
sanctuary of her great temple and they talked
over all that had happened during Persephone&rsquo;s
long absence. She told her mother how Hades
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
had stolen her away from the meadows while
she gathered flowers, and how he had treated
her while she stayed with him in the lower
world. She had only words of love and honor
for the dread King of the Dead.</p>

<p>A whole day mother and daughter passed
in an affectionate embrace and in exchanging
words of love, each pitying the other on account
of the long separation. Then Zeus sent Rhea
to bring Demeter and Persephone to Mount
Olympos. And he told them that Persephone
might remain with her mother until the winter
months came back again.</p>

<p>To this Demeter seriously objected, for she
dreaded the separation and the loneliness. But
Zeus replied: &ldquo;If thy daughter hath eaten of
the pomegranate she is truly wedded to Hades
the King of the Dead, and must go back to him
to stay during the winter. For the pomegranate
is the apple of love, and having shared it with
him, he hath part in her affection and can claim
her as his wife. But if she hath not eaten of
the fruit she shall remain with thee and go no
more to the gloomy realms below.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Demeter was satisfied with these terms and
promised that Persephone should return to her
honored husband during the winter months, for
Persephone had told her that she had eaten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
with him of the pomegranate and that she loved
him in spite of his gloomy surroundings. Then
Demeter forgave Zeus for his part in allowing
the abduction of Persephone, and the mother
and daughter descended once more to Eleusis
to bestow blessings upon the inhabitants, and
from that time on the earth was clad in flowers
and foliage as long as Persephone stayed with
her mother. But it was brown and barren
when she returned to the regions of the Dead.
And the good Hades warmed the earth from
below by virtue of his divine power, helping
it to produce more abundantly the precious
grains and the fragrant flowers.</p>

<span class="smlfont">TRIPTOLEMOS BECOMES A HERO. DEMETER&rsquo;S
GIFT</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Demeter</span> returned to her home among the
gods on Mount Olympos. But before she went
she called Triptolemos, an older son of King
Keleos to her and gave him her car which was
drawn by winged dragons. There is nothing
more precious to the gods than open, benevolent
hearts and generous hospitality. The
poorest and meanest man may be god-like in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
generosity, sharing his goods with open hand,
as sunshine is poured out from the heavens.
King Keleos had shown himself a most royal-hearted
man in his princely generosity toward
the goddess when she came in the guise of a
poor old woman, and Demeter resolved to bestow
upon him and upon mankind, for his sake,
a blessing proportionate to her power and rank.</p>

<p>So she gave to Triptolemos something far
better than her magic car and serpent-steeds.
She taught him how to make the plough of
iron. Heretofore men had ploughed the fields
with the crudest of ploughs&mdash;a pointed stick,
or an iron bar. She taught him how to turn a
furrow and put the seed into it, and cover it up
so that the birds should not eat it.</p>

<p>And when summer came she showed him how
to cut the grain, to bring it in wagons to the
barn where he was to thrash it, and to store it
away, keeping each kind separate.</p>

<p>Triptolemos, being carried on his wagon
through the air, sowed the precious grain all
over the inhabited world and turned many a
barren waste into a cultivated field. He taught
the people everywhere, as Demeter had taught
him, how to cultivate the soil. Thus he became
a great benefactor to all mankind and induced
a better way of living. For when people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
had farms to take care of, they ceased to roam
aimlessly about the world. They built homes
and learned to be friendly, and from this sprang
up the government which should protect the
home and make men happy and comfortable.</p>

<p>Triptolemos received the honors of a god,
and the people of Eleusis built a temple to him
close to the acropolis, where some of the stones
of the temple may still be seen. But his best
monument is the cultivated fields of barley,
rye, and oats, and all the grains which from
Demeter (Ceres) we call cereals.</p>

<h2><a name="chap33" id="chap33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII<br />

<span class="smlfont">PROMETHEUS, THE CHAMPION OF MANKIND</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Heaven</span> and earth were created. The sea
rolled its waves against the shore and played
around the islands. The fishes sported in the
waters in lively gambols. On the land the
birds flew from tree to tree singing with sweetest
voices; wild beasts were peaceable; flowers
threw out delicious odors; nature beamed with
loveliness.</p>

<p>But mankind could not notice the beauty of
nature. Men walked as in a dream, for they
were not awakened to delicate odors or sweet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
sounds or beautiful forms and colors. They
were barbarous and rude; they did not know
any of the arts of civilization; they were not
even able to build homes; they lived in caves
like wild beasts and fed on nuts and fruit.</p>

<p>The cultivation of the soil was unknown.
Men made no difference between the blooming
spring and fruitful summer and the cold winter.
They did not know how to cut stone. Like the
wild creatures they lived in constant fear,
crawling about miserably.</p>

<p>Prometheus, the son of Japetos, was wise and
good. He looked down from his comfortable
abode and saw with pity how man was stupefied
and enthralled by ignorance, and he wished
to deliver him from his unhappy state. At
that time Zeus reigned in the heavens; he was
the lord of thunder and of fire. He stored the
fire in the heavens and sent it down to earth in
the form of lightning to terrify men but not to
help them.</p>

<p>Without fire upon earth man&rsquo;s condition was
hopeless. He needed it for making tools, if
ever he learned to forge metals, for baking clay
with which to make bricks and dishes, for cooking
his food, and protecting himself from the
biting frosts of winter. But Zeus does not
willingly part with his treasures, and he looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
upon fire as property solely his own. No one
could get it from him by open means, and man
had not even dreamed that he needed it.</p>

<p>Prometheus made it a part of his own duty
to teach man the use of fire and how to live
better by knowing its secrets. So he went to
Olympos, the home of Zeus himself, and took a
few sparks of the heavenly fire, which he hid in
a hollow reed so that it could not go out. He
came down to earth, bringing it to men, and
they made a great blaze and gave thanks to
Prometheus from the depths of their hearts
when they saw what it would do.</p>

<p>When it grew cold they sat around the big
fire and warmed themselves. They began to
cook their food, they melted iron and made
spears and tools. They baked clay which they
had moulded into dishes, and it led on to their
inventing all those things that are made by the
use of fire.</p>

<p>When Zeus looked down from the heavens
and saw the light of the flames on the earth he
at once became aware that Prometheus had
stolen the fire from him and given it to mortals.
Zeus was greatly alarmed to find his power
shared by men, for the lightning had been his
sceptre. He called Heph&aelig;stos to his aid, the
Blacksmith of the Gods, and his powerful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
servants, Violence and Force, and bade them lead
Prometheus far away and chain him to a lofty
peak in the Caucasus, a wild mountain-range of
Scythia.</p>

<p>Heph&aelig;stos loved Prometheus, but he could
not disobey the command of Zeus. When
they reached the Caucasus, Violence said to
Heph&aelig;stos: &ldquo;See! we have reached far off
Scythia, a desert where no trace of man is ever
found. Behold the Caucasus! Now is the time
to perform the task with which thy father Zeus
hath charged thee. Let us chain Prometheus
to the highest rock with fetters which cannot
be broken. Thus may he learn the will of Zeus
and that he is subject to his rule. Thus, too,
will he see where his love for wretched men
has brought him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Heph&aelig;stos answered: &ldquo;Force and Violence,
do ye execute the order of Zeus, for I
have not the heart to fetter a god who is of my
own kin, to this wild mountain. It must be
done, because it is the will of Zeus, and it is a
dangerous thing to disobey him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, turning to Prometheus, he said:
&ldquo;High-minded son of Heaven, it is with a sorrowful
heart and against my will that I let my
servants bind thee with never-breaking bonds
to this rock. There thou wilt never hear a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
human voice nor see a human form. Here
wilt thou stay with no power to stir, and the
burning sun will scorch thee. There is no
place where thou canst rest thy weary limbs
or thy sleepless head. This is thy reward for
thy love to mankind. But I would rather bear
thy punishment than be the tyrant to treat thee
so unjustly.&rdquo;</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="chap34" id="chap34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />

<span class="smlfont">PROMETHEUS UNBOUND</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Prometheus</span> was securely bound with iron
fetters and fastened to the solid rock. The
servants of Heph&aelig;stos increased his tortures
with their bitter speeches. But Prometheus
bore his sufferings and their taunts with heroic
indifference and courage. As long as they
were near not a sound came from his lips.
Only when Heph&aelig;stos and his servants were
gone did he begin to bewail his unjust punishment.</p>

<p>The winds carried the sound of his moans
far off to the shore of the sea. The sea maidens,
daughters of old Ocean, heard them and
were moved to tearful pity. They hastened on
the wings of the salt breeze like a swarm of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
birds to comfort and cheer him. Nay, more,
old Ocean himself came from afar, and rising
up from his watery abode, stationed himself
near Prometheus to speak to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am grieved to the heart, dear Prometheus,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;for all that thou hast to suffer.
I am thy kin, and it breaks my heart to see thee
like this. Even apart from our kinship there
is no one whom I honor as much as thee. Tell
me, is there any way in which I can help thee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prometheus, hearing what Okeanos said,
made reply: &ldquo;What do my eyes behold, friend
Okeanos? Hast thou come to see me in my
misery? I fear me I have only bitter words in
exchange for thy kindly greeting. See in
what manner Zeus treats me, his friend, who
hath assisted him to gain possession of the
throne of the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Okeanos felt the truth of his words, but
thought it better to try to persuade Prometheus
to submit to Zeus, and so he answered
pleadingly: &ldquo;Curb such overbearing speeches,
dear Prometheus, and I will myself try to appease
the anger of Zeus.&rdquo; But Prometheus
quickly replied: &ldquo;I have done no evil that I
know of, and I will not bow to tyranny and injustice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My fault is this: I loved mankind too well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
to let them lie helpless in stupidity and ignorance.
I found them in a pitiable plight. They
had eyes but could not see. They had ears but
could not hear. Not one thing did they know
until I taught them. I told them to observe
the rising and the setting of the sun, moon, and
stars. I taught them how to count, and write,
and remember.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I taught them to yoke oxen to their ploughs
instead of dragging them themselves. And I
showed them how to harness horses to the
chariots likewise. I helped them to make boats
with oars for the rivers, and ships winged with
white sails to traverse the seas. I taught them
the healing power of plants to relieve them in
their sickness. From me they learned how to
mine for silver and copper, and how to work
them. Indeed, friend Okeanos, thou mayst
well say that all the arts men know how to apply
they have learned from Prometheus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zeus sat uneasily on his throne, angry when
he saw that the spirit of Prometheus was unbroken.
&ldquo;He still defies me, but I will conquer
yet,&rdquo; said the Thunderer; and he sent a cruel
vulture to tear and eat his vitals every day.
At night they grew again and he was healed.
But each morning the vulture came and renewed
his terrible feast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
Two thousand years the large hearted, man-loving
Prometheus passed in suffering in the
Caucasus. At length Herakles came that way
in his wanderings, when he was trying to find
his way to the Garden of the Hesperides. He
broke the iron bands like egg shells and set
Prometheus free.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Prometheus was too wise
for Zeus to have him as an enemy forever, for
he knew one thing which Zeus did not&mdash;he
knew the future. Zeus was aware that there
were many important secrets concerning the
future which he could learn from no one else. It
is supposed that Zeus may have hoped to force
Prometheus to yield up his secrets by these
punishments, and that on finding out his mistake
he slyly connived at his victim&rsquo;s liberation
because he could not afford to be unreconciled
to him any longer.</p>

<p>Prometheus has been loved and honored
through all the ages. On an island belonging
to Greece the people built an altar to him at
the foot of a burning mountain. Once a year
they put out all their fires and sent a ship to
Delos to bring a fresh light. They used this
new flame for kindling again the fires they had
extinguished.</p>

<p>At Athens, Prometheus was held in sacred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
honor. People held torch-light festivals in
memory of him. And on frosty nights, as they
sat by the fire, they praised the great Prometheus,
who could endure long enough to conquer
destiny, the hero who had brought them
mental balance, &ldquo;The Gift of Equilibrium.&rdquo;</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="chap35" id="chap35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV<br />

<span class="smlfont">DEUKALION, THE CHAMPION OF A NEW RACE</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Deukalion</span> was the son of Prometheus, and
a just and god-fearing man. In the time of Deukalion,
Zeus destroyed the human race by means
of a great flood. People had become wicked and
godless; they did not fear the gods, and the
meaner classes paid no respect to the better, and
all of them loved every manner of wickedness.</p>

<p>This state of affairs reached the ears of Zeus.
But wishing to take the evidence of his own
eyes and see if the stories that came to him
were really true, he took the form of a mortal
man and went down from his Olympian home
to the Earth.</p>

<p>One evening after sunset he reached Arcadia
and asked for a night&rsquo;s shelter in the palace of
Lykaon, the king. Lykaon was famous for his
wickedness. Some of the people seemed to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
some signs that Zeus was a god and went down
on their knees to him, but Lykaon laughed at
their credulity and said: &ldquo;Stay till I find out
whether he be a god or a man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lykaon had a stranger in his palace who had
been sent to him as a messenger. Lykaon had
the stranger killed and served up as food for
his guest. When the dreadful feast was placed
before Zeus, he arose at once in anger and left
the table, and he shattered the house with a
thunder-bolt. Lykaon betook himself to flight
with all speed. He fled to the fields howling
like a wild beast.</p>

<p>Lykaon tried to speak, but his human voice
had left him. His skin turned into a wolf&rsquo;s
pelt, his hands into paws. He rushed furiously
among the herds and began to tear and bite
cattle and sheep. He had been changed into a
wolf.</p>

<p>Zeus, having seen with his own eyes that
things were even worse than had been told him,
returned to Olympos. He called the gods together
in council and related to them the wicked
deeds he had seen. He ended by saying: &ldquo;The
whole race of man must surely perish,&rdquo; and the
other gods consented to his judgment.</p>

<p>At first Zeus thought it best to send thunder-bolts
to destroy the evil race, but he feared that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
the flames might reach from earth into the
heavens and burn the whole firmament. He
therefore laid aside his thunder-bolts and resolved
to drown the earth&rsquo;s inhabitants by
means of a flood. So he ordered the God of the
Winds to shut Boreas and all the other winds in
his cave, save Notos, only, the wet south wind,
who was to go free.</p>

<p>Then Notos flew forth with his damp wings.
A thick cloud hid his face like a veil and darkness
hung around his head. Water ran down
from his brow and his hair. Cloud-bursts broke
from the sky and sent cataracts of water over
the earth, flooding it in every direction. The
work of the farmers was stopped and their
hopes destroyed in an instant.</p>

<p>But Zeus was not satisfied with that. He
called Poseidon, Lord of the Seas, to his assistance.
Poseidon came quickly. He spoke to
all the rivers in a loud commanding voice.
&ldquo;Leave your beds,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and rush wildly
over your banks and flood the world!&rdquo; The
rivers obeyed, and Poseidon himself struck the
earth with his trident. The earth quaked and,
bursting open in many places, let forth torrents
of water.</p>

<p>The waters rose higher and higher. The
valleys became one wide lake, and soon the tops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
of the trees were no longer above the water.
Man and herds were drowned. The altars of
the gods were swept away. When a house
remained standing it was soon covered with
water. The highest towers disappeared in the
flood. Land and sea were no longer separated.
The world was all sea&mdash;a long, shoreless sea.</p>

<p>Seals gambolled where goats had formerly
grazed. Dolphins swam over the cities that
were buried beneath the waves. Wolves and
sheep, lions and tigers huddled close together
and swam about as long as they could keep
afloat, when they sank below the waters. The
deer could no longer find ground for his fleet
foot. The birds flew on tired, trembling wings
searching for a place on which to perch and
finally fell into the sea with worn-out wings.</p>

<p>The people tried to save themselves in any
possible way. Some fled to the hills and
mountains. Some took refuge in ships and
sailed over the fields where formerly the plough
had moved. By and by the mountain-tops
were swept by the waves, and the ships were
whirled about by the terrible currents and
wrecked.</p>

<p>Deukalion and his wife, Pyrrha, were the
only ones to be saved. He had taken the advice
of his father, Prometheus, to build himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
a floating-house in the form of a box and to
store in it a great amount of food; when the
flood came he entered this house with his wife.
The house was carried about nine days and
nine nights by the winds. Only the two peaks
of Parnassos remained above water. On this
mountain the floating-house stuck fast.</p>

<p>When Zeus cast his eyes down to earth he
saw that everything was covered with water,
on the surface of which floated trees and
grasses and thousands of animals and people
who had perished in the flood. And he saw
Deukalion and his wife safely anchored on the
heights of Parnassos.</p>

<p>Then Zeus gave commands to Boreas to
chase away the black clouds. The sun shone
again and the waters retreated from the earth,
which was soon dry again. Poseidon laid
aside his trident and the rivers ran in their old
channels. Woods sprang up and the fields
bloomed with flowers.</p>

<p>Deukalion and Pyrrha looked around them.
Everywhere was loneliness and silence. It
was like the solitude of death. Deukalion
wept and said to his beloved Pyrrha: &ldquo;My
dear wife, I do not see a living soul far or near
in any direction. Thou art my only companion.
All the friends we have known have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
perished in the flood. We are the only inhabitants
of the earth. What will life be worth to us,
since we must live alone in the world with no
fellow-men. I should like better to live if we
had other people whom we might love and help
and with whom we could enjoy ourselves. But
we will give thanks to Zeus for saving us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked along a little way and came to
an altar of the Goddess of Justice. There they
fell on their knees and said: &ldquo;Oh, divine Justice,
tell us how we may revive the human race
which has perished. Oh, help us and restore
our lost ones to us.&rdquo; They listened for the
goddess to answer and soon they heard a soft
voice reply: &ldquo;Veil your faces, oh, Deukalion
and Pyrrha. Go down the mountain, and as
ye go throw backward over your shoulders
the bones of your mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deukalion and his wife were puzzled at
these words and at first they could not tell
what they meant. But after some meditation
Deukalion said: &ldquo;My dear wife, the earth is
our mother and her bones are the rocks. As
we go down the mountain we will cast behind
us the stones which we find in our pathway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they started forth, the founders of a new
race, throwing the stones and rocks which
they met over their shoulders and out of sight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
From the stones which they cast there sprang
up living men and women; the stones which
Deukalion threw became men and those which
Pyrrha cast became women.</p>

<p>Deukalion and Pyrrha had many children.
One of their sons was called Hellen. Hellen&rsquo;s
children and grandchildren spread over Greece
and were called Hellenes, and they gave the
name Hellas to Greece.</p>

<h2><a name="chap36" id="chap36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI<br />

<span class="smlfont">D&AElig;DALOS, A HERO OF INVENTION</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">D&aelig;dalos</span> was a native of Athens and descended
from one of the most ancient kings of
Attica. It was he who constructed the labyrinth
in which King Minos of Crete locked up
the monster Minotaur. D&aelig;dalos was the greatest
artist of his time and was master of many
useful crafts. He produced wonderful pieces
of work in a great many places of the world.</p>

<p>His statues were so cleverly made that they
were taken for living beings. It was thought
that they could see and walk about. For while
the artists before him sculptured their statues
with closed eyes, with their hands crossed over
their breasts, and their feet turned sidewise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
D&aelig;dalos made statues with open eyes, outstretched
arms, and feet pointing forward into
space.</p>

<p>D&aelig;dalos had Talos for a disciple, a clever
and intelligent youth, who, though but a mere
boy, had invented several tools of great usefulness.
One day, finding the jaw-bone of a snake
he began to cut a piece of wood with it. It
was hardly sharp enough to answer his purpose,
so he constructed a saw of iron on the
same plan.</p>

<p>D&aelig;dalos was so jealous of the boy that he
pushed him off from the Acropolis and the lad
died of the injury. When D&aelig;dalos saw what
he had done he went to Talos, but found him
dead, so he hurried to bury him. He was surprised
in the act and brought before the court
which met on the hill called Areopagus. He
was condemned to death by the court, and in
order to save himself he fled to Crete.</p>

<p>At that time Minos was king in Crete. He
received the famous artist very kindly and
held him in great honor. There D&aelig;dalos did
many fine works for Minos besides the famous
labyrinth for the Minotaur.</p>

<p>After he had stayed some time in Crete he
wanted to go away. But Minos did not wish
to let him go, and when D&aelig;dalos concealed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
himself, the king searched for him everywhere
and gave the order that no ship should take
him away from the island.</p>

<p>The ingenious D&aelig;dalos then meditated a
plan of flight. Suddenly he exclaimed, &ldquo;Minos
may watch the sea and the land, but he cannot
watch the air. That is still free. I will make
me wings and fly away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>D&aelig;dalos constructed two large wings and
fastened them to his body with wax. Moving
them with his arms and hands he was able to
fly like a bird. He made another pair of wings
for his son Ikaros, fastened them to the boy&rsquo;s
body and taught him how to move them. Then
he instructed Ikaros to keep close to him and
not to fly too high lest the wax should be
melted by the heat of the sun, nor to keep too
near the surface of the sea, as he might dip his
wings into the water and render them too
heavy for flight.</p>

<p>After he had given this advice, he flew up
first and his son followed. Away they went,
cutting through the air like two eagles, and soon
the high mountains of Crete were left far behind
them. Below them the wide sea stretched out
its great expanse. The sailors looked up from
their boats and wondered what these strange
beings were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
They flew over fields where farmers were
ploughing, and the farmers gazed up with
astonishment. But D&aelig;dalos and Ikaros flew
on and on, heedless of all that was going on
below. The fishermen forgot to take in their
fish and the farmers forgot to urge their oxen
on with the goad, but kept gazing into the sky
until the flying people were out of sight.</p>

<p>At first Ikaros kept close in the wake of his
father, but when his confidence grew stronger
he rose up higher. He forgot his father&rsquo;s advice
and flew very high into the air. Up, up
to the sun as nearly as he could go. The wax
melted. The wings parted and fell to pieces,
and Ikaros was precipitated like a stone into
the sea.</p>

<p>D&aelig;dalos missed the boy in a short time and
turned back to look for him. He could not
see him anywhere, so he called: &ldquo;Ikaros,
Ikaros, my son, where art thou?&rdquo; But Ikaros
made no answer. D&aelig;dalos flew about in great
agony, and at last he saw the wings of his son
floating on the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>Then D&aelig;dalos knew that his beloved Ikaros
was drowned. He descended to an island and
searched the cliffs, and at length he found the
body of Ikaros, which the waves had washed
ashore. With tears and lamentations D&aelig;dalos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
buried his only son, and thus was he punished
for the death of his disciple, Talos. And the
sea in which Ikaros was drowned was called
the Icarian Sea from that time.</p>

<span class="smlfont">PHAETHON, A HERO OF BAD FORTUNE</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Helios</span>, the god of the Day, had a famous
son whose name was Phaethon. Helios drove
the chariot of the Sun through the heavens,
and Phaethon played by the sea-shore where
his mother lived. She was a daughter of Old
Ocean and had many daughters of her own.
Phaethon grew to be a youth of great promise,
but he had one fault, an excessive conceit.</p>

<p>When he had grown to be a young man he
left his mother&rsquo;s home and went to his father
to receive the more manly instructions which
belong to those of heavenly descent. When
he reached the wonderful palace of Helios,
which was built of gold and precious stones, he
sat down and rested near the glittering columns,
his self-pride growing with the thought
of being one of the heirs to such an estate.</p>

<p>He rose and entered the silver gates which
shone like mirrors. He found Helios in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
palace surrounded by a flood of light, sitting
on a throne shaped out of an emerald. To the
right and left of Helios stood Hemera (the
Day), Men (the Month), Etos (the Year), the
&AElig;ones (the Seasons), and at equal distance
from one another the Hor&aelig; (Hours), and Ages
unnumbered. There also stood Spring adorned
by a wreath of flowers, Summer with ears of
grain in his hands, Autumn laden with juicy
fruits, and Winter with his white hair.</p>

<p>Phaethon halted in awe. But Helios, as
soon as he perceived him, welcomed him to
his palace. He took the crown of golden rays
from his own head lest its dazzling splendor
should blind the eyes of Phaethon, and then
called him to come nearer.</p>

<p>Phaethon approached with fear and trembling,
but Helios called him his son and reassured
him with endearing words. When
Phaethon&rsquo;s eyes had grown somewhat accustomed
to the blinding splendor, Helios said to
him with fatherly love: &ldquo;What has brought
my dear child into the heavenly palace of his
father? Surely this is hardly the place for anyone
who is accustomed to the cool earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phaethon answered: &ldquo;Oh, my royal father,
I am very unhappy. I am the subject of much
gossip and derision. People taunt me because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
my father lives in the heavens and does not
abide in our home on earth. They say that I
am not thy son at all, and I have come to thee
to get the proof from thee that I am really thy
son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now if Helios had lived upon earth everything
would have been burned up in the light
of his glittering rays, but he felt sorry for his
son and said: &ldquo;Thou art my dear son, indeed.
I would gladly leave this palace to come and
abide in thy home by the sea. But I must
drive the chariot of the Day. Even the gods
are not exempt from duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then said Phaethon: &ldquo;If thou art indeed my
father, thou wilt grant me the boon which I ask
of thee.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ask what thou wilt,&rdquo; replied Helios,
&ldquo;and I swear to thee by the waters of the Styx,
that I will give it to thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Phaethon made answer: &ldquo;Let me
drive thy chariot for one day and all these
people who despise me will see that I am thy
son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helios was dismayed when he heard the audacious
and unexpected demand of his son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What words hast thou spoken, my dear
Phaethon!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thou dost ask for thine
own destruction. Thou dost request a thing
that no one of the gods would dare to undertake,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
not even Zeus himself. No one but myself
is able to drive my chariot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Phaethon would not be persuaded.
&ldquo;Thou dost not love me, my father,&rdquo; he said
with tears. &ldquo;I see that thou dost not love me.
If thou didst thou wouldst let me have thy
chariot in order that the whole world might
see that I am indeed thy son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foolish boy,&rdquo; responded Helios, &ldquo;just because
I love thee shall I let thee destroy thyself?
Ask any other boon but this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I want the chariot and nothing else,&rdquo;
replied Phaethon.</p>

<p>Helios was stricken with grief, but he had
bound himself by the Great Oath of the Gods,
which cannot be broken. He took Phaethon
by the hand and led him to his chariot and
placed him in it.</p>

<p>The chariot was a wonderful piece of workmanship
done by Heph&aelig;stos. The seat and
axle were made of gold. Golden also were the
tires of the wheels and the spokes were of silver.</p>

<p>While Phaethon was yet gazing with wonder
at the glittering chariot of his father, the rosy-fingered
Dawn opened the dazzling gates of
the East, the stars, one after another, set&mdash;last
of all the Morning Star, and the light of the
Moon died out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
Helios ordered the Hours to harness up his
immortal steeds, which were always fed on
nectar and ambrosia. The Hours brought the
horses up from the stables and yoked them
to the chariot. While this was done Helios
anointed the face of his son with heavenly oil,
lest he might be scorched by the fiery rays.
Then he placed his radiant crown upon Phaethon&rsquo;s
head, and sighing bitterly, gave his son
this parting advice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son, do not touch the horses with the
whip, but hold on to the reins with all thy
might. The horses are impetuous and thou
wilt find it hard to hold them. Keep them well
in hand when making the ascent as well as in
the descent. First thy course is steeply upward,
and on the other side it descends rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not go near the earth lest thou burn it,
and do not rise too high or thou wilt set fire to
the heavens. The twilight is waning. Go,
my son, for mortals are looking for the light of
Helios. At the last moment I pray thee to
change thy mind and hand the reins to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the son, exulting with joy, gathered up
the reins, and taking leave of his disconsolate
father, boldly drove off.</p>

<h2><a name="chap38" id="chap38"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br />

<span class="smlfont">THE DEATH OF PHAETHON</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> horses darted forward to their long race,
and their first few leaps brought them above
the highest mountains. Before the eyes of the
youth the whole extent of land and sea lay outstretched.</p>

<p>The deer already had left their shelters and
gone up on the heights. All nature seemed to
awake. The quiet woods resounded with the
songs of the birds, which seemed to greet the
rising sun. Glittering dewdrops hung on the
leaves and flowers and shone like diamonds
with the light of Helios. Hares and rabbits
left their hiding-places and came forth for food.
Bees flew humming from flower to flower,
gathering their precious sweets. The shepherd
led forth his bleating flocks into the green
pastures, the farmer plodded off into the fields
with his rural tools. Smoke began to rise
from the cottage chimneys.</p>

<p>Only the owls and other night-birds, unable
to bear the light of the sun, flew back to their
lonely hiding-places, and a few timid flowers
closed their petals, but the sun-flowers turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
their faces with joy toward the rising sun.
Phaethon was entranced by the sight of the
glorious beauty of awakening nature.</p>

<p>The horses soon perceived that they were
not held by the powerful hands of Helios; they
also felt that they were not drawing their accustomed
burden, and as a ship that does not
carry the necessary ballast is tossed about by
the waves, so the chariot was jolted through
the air, rising and falling as if it were empty.</p>

<p>The horses strayed from their path. Phaethon
tried to rein them in. He did not know
the way and was not strong enough to curb the
restive steeds. They ran this way and that, to
right and left, under the uncertain guidance of
their new driver.</p>

<p>On they flew. They were near the middle of
the sky where the road was steepest. Phaethon
looked down from the tremendous height
upon the earth. He became dizzy; his hands
trembled and his knees knocked together. He
let the reins go loose; the horses darted forward
like arrows. He pulled them back, and
they plunged and stood on their hind feet. He
wanted to speak to them, but he did not know
their names.</p>

<p>Overcome at last by fear, he threw the reins
down on the backs of the horses and clung to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
the chariot. Having no guidance whatever the
horses now started on a wild race. They approached
the earth and turned everything into
a desert; woods and meadows, cities and villages
were burnt to ashes. The rivers were
dried up and the sea was boiling.</p>

<p>Again the chariot was borne up to an immeasurable
height and the earth was relieved
of the terrible heat. But now the firmament
was in danger of being destroyed by fire.
Curses and prayers rose to heaven from the
suffering people on earth, and cries of fright
resounded through Olympos.</p>

<p>Zeus heard the sighs and wailings and cries,
and to save the world from destruction he
hurled his thunder-bolt at the unfortunate
Phaethon, who fell from the dizzy heights to
earth. With tears and lamentations his mother
searched for the body of her wayward son.
She found him near the mouth of a great river
which had been burned dry.</p>

<p>There she buried him, and the sisters of the
unfortunate youth shed bitter tears over his
grave. They could not bear to go away from
the tomb and leave him lying there alone, so
they remained kneeling and motionless until
Zeus took pity on them and changed them into
weeping willows. Even then they kept on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
weeping, but their tears were dried by the sun
and carried away by the streams into the great
sea, where they became jewels of amber.</p>

<p>Kyknos, too, a friend of Phaethon&rsquo;s, mourned
his loss and could not be comforted; so Zeus,
in kindness, changed him into a swan. Helios,
in his fatherly grief, refused to drive the chariot
of the Sun any longer, and the earth was
left in darkness for a whole day. But the gods
entreated him to take the reins again and men
prayed for light, and from that time on the Sun
has kept its true course through the heavens,
under his wise guidance.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
